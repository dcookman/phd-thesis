Measuring the ``solar'' neutrino oscillation parameters \dmsq{} and \tonetwo{} is one of the principal aims of the SNO+ detector during the scintillator phase. There are, in fact, two complementary methods of measuring these parameters: the oscillations of anti-neutrinos from terrestrial nuclear reactors, and the oscillations of neutrinos from the Sun.

This chapter focuses on the latter approach, using \beight{} neutrinos coming from the Sun to measure the solar oscillation parameters. An initial background-free study was performed by Javi Caravaca~\cite{caravacaSNOSensitivityStandard2020}, % Javi's tech note
which demonstrated that it was indeed possible to make such a measurement in the detector. The work in this chapter builds substantially from that analysis. This chapter also draws on the associated reactor anti-neutrino analysis built by Iwan Morton-Blake~\cite{morton-blakeFirstMeasurementReactor2021}, % Iwan's thesis
and more broadly from the general techniques used in the \onbb{} analysis of Tereza Kroupova~\cite{kroupovaImprovingSensitivityNeutrinoless2020} and Jack Dunger~\cite{dungerTopologicalTimeBased2018}.% Tereza & Jack's thesis

This chapter begins by explaining how it is possible to measure the solar oscillation parameters via \beight{} events. Then, the framework used to perform the analysis is explained: that of a \textit{Bayesian Analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques}. After the method has been described, the dataset upon which the analysis is performed is introduced. The results are then given. Given these results, a projection is then made for the expected sensitivity to \tonetwo{} as a function of livetime.


\section{Analysis Methodology}\label{sec:analysis_method}
\subsection{Observational Principle}\label{sec:solar_obs_principle}
There are three key properties of solar neutrinos and their interactions that enable neutrino oscillations to be measured. The first of these is the dependence of the electron neutrino survival probability, $P_{ee}$, on both the individual oscillation parameters and the neutrino energy. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:nu_osc_phenom}, $P_{ee}$ is dependent on the oscillation parameters \tonetwo{} and $\theta_{13}$ when propagating through the vacuum of space (after averaging over very many oscillations), and the effective oscillation parameters $\theta_{12}^{M}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{M,21}$ when passing through the Sun or Earth. By Eq.~\ref{eq:matter_osc_params}, this leads to an overall dependence of $P_{ee} = P_{ee}\left(\theta_{12}, \theta_{13}, \Delta m^{2}_{12}\right)$.

Fig.~\ref{fig:pee_osc_param_dependence} shows the dependence of each of these oscillation parameters on $P_{ee}(E)$, as well as the oscillation parameter $\Delta m^{2}_{13}$ for comparison. It is clear that only the parameters \dmsq{} and \tonetwo{} have a substantial impact on $P_{ee}(E)$. Because of this, only \dmsq{} and \tonetwo{} will be varied in this analysis, with $\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{13}$ being fixed at the global fit values shown in Table~\ref{tab:nufit_osc_params}.

% Let us now consider the dependence of $P_{ee}$ on the individual neutrino oscillation parameters. Recall from Eq.~\ref{eq:pee_msw} %
% that, after considering matter-induced oscillations due to neutrinos passing through the Sun and possibly the Earth, $P_{ee} = P_{ee}\left(\tan2\theta^{M}_{12}, \sin\theta^{M}_{13}, \Delta m^{2}_{21,M}\right) = P_{ee}\left(\theta_{12}, \theta_{13}, \Delta m^{2}_{12}, \Delta m^{2}_{13}\right)$. Fig.~\ref{fig:pee_osc_param_dependence} shows the dependence of each of these four oscillation parameters on $P_{ee}(E)$. We can see that in reality only the two parameters \dmsq{} and \tonetwo{} have a substantial impact on $P_{ee}(E)$ and hence the observed electron energy spectrum. Because of this, for this analysis we will only ever vary these two oscillation parameters, and keep $\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{13}$ at their current ``NuFit 5.1'' global fit values\footnote{We use the global fit results excluding Super-Kamiokande's atmospheric data, and assuming normal ordering of the neutrino mass hierarchy. This choice has a tiny impact on the magnitudes of these two fixed parameters, the main impact being the sign of $\Delta m^{2}_{13}$.} % Confirm that mass hierarchy has no impact on Pee.

    \label{fig:pee_osc_param_dependence}
\end{figure}

This dependence of $P_{ee}$ on the oscillation parameters is not enough on its own to allow \dmsq{} and \tonetwo{} to be measured. If a purely NC weak interaction was used to detect the solar neutrinos, then there would be no way of telling the flavour-state of an interacting neutrino. The second property that enables solar neutrino oscillation measurements is that of neutrino-electron elastic scattering, the interaction mechanism used in this analysis. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:nu_osc_evidence}, this interaction has an additional CC mode for electron neutrinos only, on top of an NC mode for all flavours of neutrino. This modifies the differential cross-section for electron neutrinos compared to other neutrino flavours. As a result, the resulting differential interaction rate $R$ for solar neutrinos in the detector as a function of the neutrino energy $E_{\nu}$, is given by:
% As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:nu_osc_evidence}, % link to theory section on solar oscillations
% it is possible to detect all flavours of neutrino through elastic scattering with electrons in the detector. Neutrinos can interact with the nuclei also, but generally the cross-sections of these interactions are orders of magnitude weaker than neutrino-electron elastic scattering~\cite{}, % CITE SOMETHING!
% so are not considered in this analysis. If the neutrino-electron elastic scattering interaction was purely neutral-current, then there would be no way of telling the flavour-state of an interacting neutrino. However, electron neutrinos are able to interact through an additional charged-current mode, which modifies the cross-section for electron neutrinos. The Sun only generates electron neutrinos, so as the survival probability for electron neutrinos ($P_{ee}$) is modified due to a change in the neutrino oscillation parameters, the interaction probability of neutrinos with the detector will also. The resulting differential interaction rate $R$ for solar neutrinos in the detector as a function of the neutrino's energy, $E_{\nu}$, is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:solar_rate}
    \frac{dR}{dE_{\nu}} = 
        \Phi_{\beight{}}S_{\nu}\left(E_{\nu}\right)n_{e}
            \left[
                P_{ee}\left(E_{\nu}\right)\sigma_{\nu_e}\left(E_{\nu}\right) +
                \left(1-P_{ee}\right)\left(E_{\nu}\right)\sigma_{\nu_\mu,\tau}\left(E_{\nu}\right)
            \right],
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_{\beight{}}$ is the total flux of \beight{} solar neutrinos, $S_{\nu}$ is the normalised incident energy spectrum of the solar neutrinos for all flavours, $n_{e}$ is the number of electron targets in the detector detection medium, and $\sigma_{\nu_{i}}$ is the neutrino-electron elastic scattering cross-section for flavour $i$.

Of course, neutrino energies are not directly measured in the detector --- only the associated scattered electron. The final property needed to observe solar neutrino oscillations is a correlation between the energies of the incident neutrino and the scattered electron. Using the formula in Eq.~\ref{eq:enu_es_xsec}, the differential cross-sections of electron neutrinos at different incident energies, as a function of the scattered electron's kinetic energy is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nu_elec_energy_dependence}. For a given value of $E_{\nu}$, conservation of energy limits the maximum allowed kinetic energy of the scattered electron, $T_{\mathrm{max}}$, to be:
\begin{equation}
    T_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{2E_{\nu}^{2}}{m_{e}+2E_{\nu}}.
\end{equation}
This kinematic limit can be very clearly seen in the shapes of the differential cross-sections. As a result, a higher energy neutrino will generate a higher energy scattered electron, on average.

\end{figure}

The combined effect that each of the above physical processes has on the energy spectrum of the solar neutrinos can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:nu_elec_energy_dependence2}. A broad energy distribution of \beight{} electron neutrinos are generated in the Sun. These neutrinos then oscillate their flavour state as they propagate to the detector, in an energy-dependent manner. When neutrinos interact with the electrons in the detector, there is both an energy- and flavour-dependence on the cross-section. The scattered electrons gain a kinetic energy with some mild dependence on the inciting neutrino's energy, which is then measured by the detector to within some energy resolution.

\subsection{Background Processes}\label{sec:background_processes}
There are a number of background processes that the solar signal must compete against. Below a reconstructed energy of $\sim\SI{2.5}{\MeV}$, it is known that low-energy backgrounds coming mainly from Uranium- and Thorium-chain isotopes coming from the natural radioactivity of the detector materials completely dominate over the \beight{} signal, and so for this analysis only processes that can generate reconstructed energies of at least $E_{\textrm{min}} = \SI{2.5}{\MeV}$ are considered. The following subsections explain each of the backgrounds present in the dataset above $E_{\mathrm{min}}$, as well as methods that have been used to mitigate them as much as possible.

\subsubsection{Internal Uranium- and Thorium-Chain Backgrounds}\label{sec:u_th_internals}
Although every effort has been made to make the scintillator cocktail that fills SNO+ to be as radio-pure as possible, there inevitably remain trace amounts of the radioactive isotopes that derive from the decay chains of the \ce{^{238}U} and \ce{^{232}Th} isotopes. Fig.~\ref{fig:u_th_decay_chains} shows these two decay chains. Only a fraction of the radioactive isotopes in these chains actually are capable of generating events in the detector with energies above $E_{\textrm{min}}$: these have been highlighted in Fig.~\ref{fig:u_th_decay_chains} in gold.

\begin{figure}[!th]

    \label{fig:u_th_decay_chains}
\end{figure}

Of particular note are the decays of \ce{^{212}Bi} and \ce{^{214}Bi}, both of which can either $\alpha-\beta$ decay via \ce{Tl}, or $\beta-\alpha$ decay via \ce{Po}. For the former, it is the subsequent $\beta$-decay of the \ce{Tl} that can have a reconstructed energy above $E_{\textrm{min}}$. For the latter, the \ce{Bi} decay is the part of the pair of decays that can lie above $E_{\textrm{min}}$. Although the $\alpha$-decays here certainly have Q-values well above \SI{2.5}{\MeV}, the liquid scintillator quenches the observed energy to well below \SI{2.5}{\MeV}. The so-called ``\ce{Bi-Po}'' decays are particularly special because the lifetimes of \ce{^{212}Po} and \ce{^{214}Po} are \SI{300}{\nano\second} and \SI{164}{\micro\second}, respectively, which are short enough to allow for highly-effective coincidence tagging of these events.

\nomenclature{\textbf{OOW}}{Out-of-window events}
\nomenclature{\textbf{IW}}{In-window events}
There are two main classes of \ce{Bi-Po} event in the detector: ``out-of-window'' (OOW) events for which the \ce{Bi} $\beta$-decay and \ce{Po} $\alpha$-decay events occur in separate triggered events, and ``in-window'' (IW) events whereby the \ce{Bi} and \ce{Po} occur within the same event. These lead to two distinct strategies for tagging these kinds of events. For out-of-window \ce{Bi-Po}s, a delayed coincidence of two events is searched for in the same position: it is assumed that in the short time between the creation and decay of the daughter nucleus, there is negligible movement relative to the mother nucleus. Using the tagging algorithm suggested in~\cite{wilsonBiPoRejectionFactors2017,kroupovaImprovingSensitivityNeutrinoless2020} % Jeanne's BiPo tagging DocDB
as a starting point, the chosen procedure is described in Table~\ref{tab:bipo_oow_tagging_requirements}. This choice of cuts was designed to be very broad, to ensure that the tagging was as \textit{efficient} in rejecting \ce{Bi-Po}s as possible, whilst negligibly impacting the solar signal. This is in contrast to the cuts chosen by Rafael Hunt-Stokes in~\cite{hunt-stokesUraniumThoriumBackground2022}, % Raf's BiPo tagging tech note on DocDB
which uses a much tighter cut on position as well as cuts on the energies of the prompt and delayed events, to try and obtain a highly \textit{pure} sample of \ce{Bi-Po} tags.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{7.5 cm}}
        \hline
        Property      & Requirement \\ \hline \hline

    \label{tab:bipo_oow_tagging_requirements}
\end{table}

The above delayed coincidence procedure cannot catch any of the IW \ce{Bi-Po} events. For these, a different approach is used. Because two decays happened in the same event, two distinct peaks in the event's time residual spectrum are expected to be seen. In order to look for this event topology, a likelihood-ratio classifier was run over events, first developed by Eric Marzec~\cite{marzecBiPoEventReduction2013} % Eric's tech note on DocDB
and re-coordinated for the \SI{2.2}{\gpl} LABPPO scintillator optics by Ziping Ye~\cite{yeTaggingInwindowBiPo2022}. % Ziping's presentation on DocDB
This classifier calculates the likelihood ratio between the null hypothesis of a \onbb{} event (a proxy in this analysis for single-decay events such as the \beight{} signal) and the alternative hypothesis of an IW \ce{Bi-Po} event. The results of this classifier are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bipo_tagging_IW}. As can be seen, the more negative the value of the result, \texttt{alphabeta212}, the greater the evidence there is for rejecting the null hypothesis of a single-site event. Events with $\texttt{alphabeta212} < 0$, % WRITE FINAL CHOICE OF CUT!
or the equivalent for \ce{^{214}Bi-Po} events, \texttt{alphabeta214}, were then rejected.

The relative normalisations before these cuts have been applied is arbitrary.}
    \label{fig:bipo_tagging_IW}
\end{figure}

\nomenclature{\textbf{ROI}}{Region of Interest (of a physics analysis)}
Combining both OOW and IW \ce{Bi-Po} tagging, the impact on \ce{^{212}Bi-Po}, \ce{^{214}Bi-Po}, and \beight{} $\nu_e$ events can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:bipo_tagging_efficiency}. Only events that pass all other cuts used in this analysis (other than the cuts for externals defined shortly) are considered: these will be explained in Section~\ref{sec:event_selection}. % link to cuts subsection
Because of the different lifetimes of the decays relative to the length of the event trigger window, \ce{^{214}Bi-Po} decays predominantly fall out-of-window whilst \ce{^{212}Bi-Po} events are typically in-window. This explains why the out-of-window tagging is substantially better at cutting \ce{^{214}Bi-Po} decays, whereas the in-window tagging far better tags \ce{^{212}Bi-Po} decays. Overall, within the analysis region of interest (ROI), the two combined cuts are able to tag 99.77\% % CALCULATE

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\alphan{} Reactions}\label{sec:alphans}
The impact of \ce{^{238}U}- and\ce{^{232}Th}-chain isotopes does not simply end at their direct decays. It is possible for the $\alpha$s generated during these decays to undergo their own interactions with nuclei in the detector. Within the organic scintillator of SNO+, the dominant interaction of this type is when an $\alpha$ collides with a \ce{^{13}C} nucleus, emitting a neutron: \ce{\alpha{} + ^{13}C -> ^{16}O + n}. This is known as an \alphan{} reaction.

The topology of this reaction in the detector is a delayed coincidence, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:alpha_n_drawing}. % Iwan's alpha-n sketch
The prompt signal can be generated through a number of processes, including the decay of an excited \ce{^{16}O} state. The neutron generated in the interaction then thermalises and gets captured by another nucleus --- usually hydrogen in SNO+ --- which creates an excited state that then eventually decays, creating a \ce{\gamma} that Compton scatters to create the delayed signal in the detector.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{6_SolarAnalysis/images/alpha_n_schematic_Iwan_modified.pdf}

    }
    \label{fig:alpha_n_drawing}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:alpha_n_coincidence_cut_impact}, \alphan{} interactions can lead to events reconstructed at a wide variety of energies, which could be an issue for this analysis. However, because they are delayed coincidence events with a typical decay time of $\sim\SI{100}{\nano\second}$, the aforementioned out-of-window and in-window \ce{Bi-Po} tagging algorithms also efficiently tag \alphan{} events. Looking again at Fig.~\ref{fig:alpha_n_coincidence_cut_impact}, simply by using the out-of-window and in-window \ce{Bi-Po} taggers without any further modifications 99.37\% of events in the ROI are cut.

    \label{fig:alpha_n_coincidence_cut_impact}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{External Backgrounds}
To distinguish between the inherent backgrounds within the scintillator, and the backgrounds from materials at larger radii, the terminology ``internal'' and ``external'', is used, respectively. External backgrounds can come from the acrylic, ropes, external water, and PMTs. These components have had their radiopurity measured throughout the detector's lifetime, often back to the construction of the original SNO detector itself. The materials other than the liquid scintillator are known to have far higher background levels, especially in the important \ce{^{238}U}- and \ce{^{232}Th}-chain backgrounds~\cite{andringaCurrentStatusFuture2016}. % good ref for this

\nomenclature{\textbf{FV}}{Fiducial Volume}
Although there are numerous external backgrounds, with an accurate and precise position reconstruction algorithm they can be efficiently rejected. The simplest approach is with a ``fiducial volume'' (FV) cut: all events that reconstruct beyond some radius are cut. The only external background events that will reach within the FV are those that have reconstructed very poorly, or have some long-distance radiation that manages to deposit radiation towards the centre of the AV. % FOM cut?
Because $\alpha$ and $\beta$ radiation can only travel short distances through the detector, it is only $\gamma$ % and neutron?
radiation that can realistically travel far enough into the detector to be able to reconstruct anywhere near the centre. Moreover, the intensity of this $\gamma$ radiation attenuates exponentially with the Compton scattering length towards the centre of the detector. This strong radial-dependence can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:external_radial_dependence}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{6_SolarAnalysis/images/externals_radial_plot.pdf}
    \caption[Radial dependence of external backgrounds relevant in this analysis, as compared to the \beight{} signal]
    {Radial dependence of external backgrounds relevant in this analysis, as compared to the \beight{} signal. Events for all processes shown here had to pass the first 6 cuts of Table~\ref{tab:ev_selection}.}
    \label{fig:external_radial_dependence}
\end{figure}

What this figure also demonstrates is that the solar signal has a completely different radial dependence to these backgrounds. As a result, if one considers not just the energy of events but also their reconstructed radius, then it is possible to get an additional handle on the external backgrounds. The FV cut can then be pushed further out to larger radii, allowing one to gain more signal statistics.

Work by Tereza Kroupova~\cite{kroupovaImprovingSensitivityNeutrinoless2020} % Tereza's thesis & full-scint re-coordination
allows for additional means of distinguishing external backgrounds from the solar signal. The underlying assumption in the reconstruction of SNO+ events is that photons were created from an electron which lost its kinetic energy in a near-point-like region of the scintillator. This is a reasonable assumption for \beight{} elastic scattering events. However, external backgrounds can fail this assumption in two ways. Firstly, these radioactive decays often generate $\gamma$ radiation in addition to the main $\alpha$/$\beta$ particle, which creates an event with energy depositions in multiple different positions: a ``multi-site'' event. Because the \texttt{scintFitter} position reconstruction algorithm is not designed to deal with multi-site events in the scintillator, the time residual distribution will change. This allows an event classifier to be built that distinguishes between the \tres{} distributions of single-site events and externals, known as the ``external background timing classifier'' (\texttt{ext0NuTimeTl208AVNaive}).

Secondly, external backgrounds should have the earliest PMT hits associated with PMTs closest to the main site of energy deposition. Because external events that reconstruct at small radii typically have a $\gamma$ that travelled a long distance towards the centre of the detector, the direction from the centre of the detector to the reconstructed position should point in the direction of the deposition from the $\gamma$, the main decay site, and hence the PMTs which were hit first. A distribution of PMT hits for a given event as a function of their angular distribution relative to this direction can be built, and compared to the expected distributions for single-site and external background events. This is known as the ``external background topological classifier'' (\texttt{ext0NuAngleTl208AV}).

Fig.~\ref{fig:external_classifier_corr} shows the correlation between the two classifier results for both \ce{^{208}Tl} decays in the acrylic, and \beight{} $\nu_{e}$ events, using MC. The other external backgrounds in MC have a similar distribution in the external classifiers to that of the \ce{^{208}Tl} decays in the acrylic.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{6_SolarAnalysis/images/externals_tagging_eff.pdf}

All events shown were in the analysis ROI, and below \SI{5}{\MeV}. Grey regions indicate the cuts used in this analysis.}
    \label{fig:external_classifier_corr}
\end{figure}

As can be seen, the external background is far more spread out along both axes compared to the signal. This allows for discrimination of external backgrounds from the signal in the \SIrange{2.5}{5.0}{\MeV} range. For this analysis, a cut on both classifiers were used: to pass, an event required $\mathtt{ext0NuTimeTl208AVNaive} > -0.007$ and $\mathtt{ext0NuAngleTl208AV} > -4.7$. By using these cuts, 37.4\% of external acrylic \ce{^{208}Tl} were cut in the analysis ROI in MC, whilst keeping 99.3\% of the \beight{} $\nu_{e}$ signal.

% \subsubsection{Cosmogenic Isotopes}
% The final source of background events are radioactive isotopes that form via collisions of cosmic rays with atomic nuclei, known as cosmogenic isotopes. Most of these isotopes are short-lived~\cite{}, % cite Borexino/KamLAND(?) paper handling cosmogenics
% with lifetimes $\mathcal{O}(\SI{1}{\second})$. Fortunately, the depth of SNO+ means that our rate of cosmic ray muons interacting with the detector is only 3 an hour~\cite{}. % cite Lorna/Katharine; Q: confident only muons? What about other kinds of cosmic rays? Presumably nothing else can penetrate this far with high enough rates
% Because the rate is so low relative to other experiments, relatively straightforward approaches to tagging and removing cosmic ray muons and their cosmogenic followers can be utilised without substantial loss of livetime. Events are tagged as a cosmic ray muon if they create a sufficient number of hits in the outward-looking PMTs above background levels, as well as many hits within the detector itself. The details of this tagging for the scintillator-fill were put in place by Lorna Nolan~\cite{}, % Lorna's thesis(?); Katharine's contribution?
% modifying the existing algorithms used in the water-phase~\cite{} % Billy's Thesis

\subsection{The Log-likelihood Test Statistic}\label{sec:test_statistic}
At the highest level, this analysis involves taking the data observed in the scintillator-fill after applying a certain set of cuts, along with simulated PDFs for all processes believed to constitute the observed data with those same cuts applied. Using these, the combined energy and radial distributions of the MC are fit to that of the data. Given a set of PDFs, a number of parameters can be modified to try and match the distribution of observables in data. These consist of the normalisations of each PDF (i.e. the total number of events observed due to that process), and any systematic parameters that could modify the shapes of these distributions. For this analysis, the neutrino oscillation parameters act as \textit{de facto} systematic parameters, as they modify the shape of the \beight{} PDFs.

The test statistic used for this analysis is the \textit{binned extended log-likelihood}:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{L}\left(\bm{\mathcal{N}}, \bm{\theta} | \bm{n}\right) &=
    -\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\mathrm{PDFs}}}\mathcal{N}_{i} 
    + \sum_{j=1}^{N_{\mathrm{bins}}}n_{j}\ln{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\textrm{PDFs}}} \mathcal{N}_{i}P_{ij}\left(\bm{\theta}\right)\right)},%\nonumber\\
    % &-\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\mathcal{N}'}}\frac{\left(\mathcal{N}_{k}' - \mathcal{N}_{k}^{\mathrm{nom}}\right)^2}{2(\sigma_{k}^{\mathcal{N}})^{2}}
    % -\sum_{\ell=1}^{N_{\theta'}}\frac{\left(\theta_{\ell}' - \theta_{\ell}^{\mathrm{nom}}\right)^2}{2(\sigma_{\ell}^{\theta})^{2}}.
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{N}_{i}$ is the normalisation parameter for the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ PDF out of $N_{\mathrm{PDFs}}$ in total, $n_{j}$ is the number of observed events in the $j^{\mathrm{th}}$ bin of data out of $N_{\mathrm{bins}}$ total bins, and $P_{ij}\left(\bm{\theta}\right)$ is the probability of observing an event of type $j$ in bin $i$, assuming a set of systematic parameters $\bm{\theta}$.

% In order to perform a fit to data in this way, we must first answer a set of questions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Which signal and background processes must we consider?\label{q:signal_v_background}
%     \item In addition to their normalisations, are there any further parameters necessary to specify the distributions of the PDFs for each of the processes? Systematics and oscillation parameters are good examples.
%     \item What is our test statistic?\label{q:test_statistic}
%     \item What algorithm do we use to try and find the best-fit result?\label{q:algorithm}
%     \item How do we measure uncertainties on these best-fit values for each parameter?\label{q:uncertainty}
% \end{enumerate}
% In section~\ref{sec:background_processes}, question~\ref{q:signal_v_background} was answered for this analysis. We now give the answer to question~\ref{q:test_statistic}; all other questions on this list will be answered shortly.

% The test statistic used for this analysis is the \textit{binned extended log-likelihood.} Once the data and MC PDFs have been binned in both the observables of interest, it is assumed that the expected number of events in a given bin $j$ is governed by a Poisson distribution:
% \begin{equation}
%     P_{j}\left(n_{j} | \lambda_{j}\right) = \frac{\lambda_{j}^{n_{j}}e^{-\lambda_{j}}}{n_{j}!},
% \end{equation}
% where $P_{j}\left(n_{j} | \lambda_{j}\right)$ is the probability of observing $n_{j}$ events in bin $j$, given an expectation of $\lambda_{j}$ events in total from signal and background processes in that bin. This $\lambda_{j}$ can be decomposed into each of the expected rates for each process, $i$:
% \begin{equation}
%     \lambda_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\textrm{PDFs}}} \mathcal{N}_{i}P_{ij}\left(\bm{\theta}\right),
% \end{equation}
% where $N_{\textrm{PDF}}$ is the number of PDFs being considered in the analysis, $\mathcal{N}_{i}$ is the normalisation parameter of the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ PDF, and $P_{ij}\left(\bm{\theta}\right)$ is the probability of observing an event of process type $j$ in bin $i$, assuming a set of non-normalisation parameters $\bm{\theta}$. By combining the probabilities of all the bins together, %and also adding the possibility of constraining any of the normalisation or systematic parameters $\bm{\mathcal{N}}$ or $\bm{\theta}$, 
% the total probability for a given set of processes assuming these parameters to give rise to the data seen is:
% \begin{align}
%     P\left(\bm{n} | \bm{\mathcal{N}}, \bm{\theta}\right) = 
%     L\left(\bm{\mathcal{N}}, \bm{\theta} | \bm{n}\right) &= 
%     \prod_{j=1}^{N_{\textrm{bins}}} \frac{\left[\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\textrm{PDFs}}} \mathcal{N}_{i}P_{ij}\left(\bm{\theta}\right)\right]^{n_{j}}e^{-\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\textrm{PDFs}}} \mathcal{N}_{i}P_{ij}\left(\bm{\theta}\right)}}{n_{j}!},
%     % \nonumber\\
%     % &\cdot\prod_{k=1}^{N_{\mathcal{N}'}}\frac{e^{-\frac{\left(\mathcal{N}_{k}' - \mathcal{N}_{k}^{\mathrm{nom}}\right)^2}{2(\sigma_{k}^{\mathcal{N}})^{2}}}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_{k}^{\mathcal{N}}}}
%     % \cdot\prod_{\ell=1}^{N_{\theta'}}\frac{e^{-\frac{\left(\theta_{\ell}' - \theta_{\ell}^{\mathrm{nom}}\right)^2}{2(\sigma_{\ell}^{\theta})^{2}}}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_{\ell}^{\theta}}}
% \end{align}

% % } 
% % on a subset of the normalisations have been included, $\left\{\mathcal{N}'\right\}$, of which there are $N_{\mathcal{N}'}$ in total. For each of these normalisations, indexed by $k$, there is an associated nominal value $\mathcal{N}_{k}^{\mathrm{nom}}$ and width $\sigma_{k}^{\mathcal{N}}$. There are similar constraints on a subset of the systematic parameters, with similarly-named variables.
% This probability can be re-framed as the likelihood of the vectors of parameters $\bm{\mathcal{N}}$ and $\bm{\theta}$ given the vector of number of events in each bin, $\bm{n}$: $L\left(\bm{\mathcal{N}}, \bm{\theta} | \bm{n}\right)$. It is rare to see the likelihood as-is, instead, for computational purposes the log-likelihood is used instead, $\mathcal{L}\left(\bm{\mathcal{N}}, \bm{\theta} | \bm{n}\right) := \ln{L}\left(\bm{\mathcal{N}}, \bm{\theta} | \bm{n}\right)$. We can then get to the formula actually used for this analysis:

% \end{align}


\subsection{The Bayesian Statistical Approach}
There are two main schools of statistical inference, ``Frequentist'' and ``Bayesian''. In the former, probabilities describe the fraction of times a situation can be found within the whole ensemble of possible worlds. For the latter, what matters instead is our degree of belief about matters in this current one. Our beliefs are updated as knowledge is acquired about the world through Bayes' Theorem:
\begin{equation}
    P\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{x}\right) = \frac{\mathcal{L}\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{x}\right)P\left(\bm{\mu}\right)}{P\left(\bm{x}\right)}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\bm{\mu}$ is the set of parameters that model a given system, $P\left(\bm{\mu}\right)$ is our \textit{prior} (pre-existing) distribution for those model parameters, and $\bm{x}$ is the data taken in an experiment. The updated, \textit{posterior} distribution $P\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{x}\right)$ is then the prior multiplied by the likelihood of parameters $\bm{\mu}$ given observations $\bm{x}$, $L\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{x}\right)$, and divided by the total probability $P\left(\bm{x}\right)$ of observing $\bm{x}$ under any circumstance. It is the Bayesian approach that has been used in this analysis.

\nomenclature{\textbf{CI}}{Credible Interval}
\nomenclature{\textbf{HPD}}{(The point of) Highest Posterior Density}
If one is able to determine the overall posterior distribution, then it is possible to derive best-fit values with uncertainties for all parameters in the fit. This is done by ``marginalising'' the posterior distribution, i.e. integrating over all parameters other than the one of interest. A sensible best-fit value is then the point of Highest Posterior Density (HPD). The uncertainty on this value is derived from the spread of the marginalised posterior, by the calculation of a $1\sigma$ Credible Interval (CI): this is a set of values for a given parameter which has a total posterior probability of 68.3\%, and contain the best-fit value. There are an infinite number of CIs that satisfy this property; for this analysis, the values have been chosen in decreasing order of marginalised posterior probability density.

\subsection{Markov Chain Monte Carlo}
The above discussion of Bayesian statistics assumes that one can accurately determine the posterior density distribution. Whilst the likelihood and prior distribution are straightforward enough to calculate, often-times $P\left(\bm{x}\right)$ (which acts as a normalisation) is very challenging to determine. This is because calculating this normalisation involves integrating the likelihood over all the parameter space, and if there are a large number of parameters this can become very numerically complex.

An alternative approach comes in the form of \textit{Markov Chain Monte Carlo}, MCMC. A Markov Chain is any mathematical system for which the next state of the system is dependent only on its current state; the system is in some sense ``memoryless''. For a large class of Markov Chains --- those that are ``ergodic'' and ``aperiodic'' --- one can prove that regardless of the initial position on the chain, the distribution of possible positions that the system can be in converges~\cite{fellerIntroductionProbabilityTheory1968}. % CITE Feller, W. (1968). An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications
MCMC uses such a Markov Chain which attempts to converge towards the posterior density distribution in particular. In MCMC, after choosing the initial position in the parameter space, successive states are chosen at random with a probability dependent only on the properties of the current position in parameter space and the proposed position. It is possible to show that, because of the convergence property of Markov chains, the set of steps made in the parameter space will have a distribution that converges to that of the posterior density distribution~\cite{fellerIntroductionProbabilityTheory1968}.

The MCMC algorithm used in this analysis is that of the \textit{Random-Walk Metropolis Algorithm}. In this algorithm, given an initial position in the parameter space $\bm{\mu}$, a new position is proposed, $\bm{\mu}'$. This position is chosen at random from a multivariate Gaussian distribution centred on the current position, with widths in each dimension of the parameter space chosen beforehand as constants. These widths are chosen through tuning the MCMC process. This choosing of a new proposed step at random is what gives the algorithm its Monte Carlo and Random Walk titles. Once a new position is proposed, it is accepted as the new position with a probability $S\left(\bm{\mu}'|\bm{\mu}\right)$ according to the condition of \textit{detailed balance}:
\begin{align}
    S\left(\bm{\mu}'|\bm{\mu}\right) &= 
    \min{\left(
        1,
        \frac{P\left(\bm{\mu}'|\bm{x}\right)}{P\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{x}\right)}
        % \frac{R\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{\mu}'\right)}{R\left(\bm{\mu}'|\bm{\mu}\right)}
        \right)
        } = 
    \min{\left(
        1,
        \frac{L\left(\bm{\mu}'|\bm{x}\right)P\left(\bm{\mu}'\right)}{L\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{x}\right)P\left(\bm{\mu}\right)}
        % \frac{R\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{\mu}'\right)}{R\left(\bm{\mu}'|\bm{\mu}\right)}
        \right)
    }\nonumber\\
    &= \min{\left(
        1,
        % \frac{R\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{\mu}'\right)}{R\left(\bm{\mu}'|\bm{\mu}\right)}
        \exp{\left[\mathcal{L}\left(\bm{\mu}'|\bm{x}\right)-\mathcal{L}\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{x}\right)+\ln{\frac{P\left(\bm{\mu}'\right)}{P\left(\bm{\mu}\right)}}\right]}
        \right)
    }.
\end{align}
% $R\left(\bm{\mu}'|\bm{\mu}\right)$ is the probability density that position $\bm{\mu}'$ is proposed as a step from position $\bm{\mu}$, and vice versa for $R\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{\mu}'\right)$. In most cases, because of the use of the same multivariate Gaussian in choosing proposals, $\frac{R\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{\mu}'\right)}{R\left(\bm{\mu}'|\bm{\mu}\right)} = 1$ simply. This component only becomes important at the edges of the parameter space, preventing the sampling probability being incorrectly impacted if a proposed step goes outside the allowed parameter space.

It is the detailed balance condition that ensures convergence of the MCMC algorithm to specifically the posterior density distribution. Crucially, because it is only dependent on the ratio of posterior densities, the hard-to-calculate normalisation $P\left(\bm{x}\right)$ in both posterior density terms cancels out, meaning one only needs to calculate the likelihood and priors for each step.
%  as well as $\frac{R\left(\bm{\mu}|\bm{\mu}'\right)}{R\left(\bm{\mu}'|\bm{\mu}\right)}$.

The specific implementation of MCMC used for this analysis is that of \texttt{OXO}, a C++ analysis framework first developed by Jack Dunger~\cite{dungerTopologicalTimeBased2018} and extended for this analysis. % Jack's thesis
\texttt{OXO} is able to run the Metropolis algorithm on multidimensional binned data, using the log-likelihood defined in Section~\ref{sec:test_statistic}. This framework also allows one to include systematic parameters that can float within the fit, and define non-uniform priors for normalisations and systematics that have constraints.

\subsection{Choosing Priors}
For this analysis, the suggestions made by Biller \& Oser in~\cite{billerAnotherLookConfidence2015} % Steve's stats paper 
about choosing prior distributions are followed: for parameters that do not have some pre-existing constraint, a flat prior is used. A nice consequence of this choice is that $\ln{\frac{P\left(\bm{\mu}'\right)}{P\left(\bm{\mu}\right)}} = 0$, so the actual value of the prior for these variables never needs to be calculated when running the MCMC algorithm. For this analysis, uniform priors are assumed on the neutrino oscillation parameters \dmsq{} and \tonetwo{}, as the magnitudes of these parameters are now well-established.

For parameters with existing asymmetric constraints $\beta^{+\sigma_{+}}_{-\sigma_{-}}$, this analysis uses an asymmetric Gaussian prior, equivalent to the logarithm of the prior being an asymmetric quadratic:
\begin{equation}
    \ln{P\left(\mu\right)} = \mathcal{A} -
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{\left(\mu-\beta\right)^{2}}{2\sigma_{+}^{2}} & \textrm{if } \mu\geq\beta,\\
        \frac{\left(\mu-\beta\right)^{2}}{2\sigma_{-}^{2}} & \textrm{if } \mu<\beta.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathcal{A}$ is the logarithm of the prior's normalisation constant, and cancels out in the detailed balance condition. For parameters with symmetric constraints, $\sigma_{+}=\sigma_{-}$, then $\ln{P\left(\mu\right)}$ reduces to a quadratic with maximum at $\mu = \beta$.

Fit parameters often also have basic physical limits on what values they can hold. Normalisation parameters, for example, must be positive. The oscillation parameters are restricted to be in the very broad range $\SI{3.0e-6}{\eV\squared}\leq\dmsq{}\leq\SI{1.0e-3}{\eV\squared}$ and $\ang{5}\leq\tonetwo{}\leq\ang{65}$. The prior density beyond these limits is zero, meaning that any proposed step outside the allowed region can be immediately rejected.

\subsection{Including Systematics in the Fit}\label{sec:sys_in_fit_theory}
One important implementation detail is how systematics are applied within the MCMC fitting process. Once systematics are added to the fit, at every step the binned PDFs for all the processes considered in the fit must get modified appropriately, which can become extremely computationally-intensive if not approached carefully. The strategy used in the \texttt{OXO} framework starts by thinking of the contents of a binned PDF as a vector of bin probabilities, $\bm{\mathrm{p}} = \left(p_{1}, p_{2}, ..., p_{N_{\textrm{bins}}}\right)^{T}$. Then, a systematic acting on the PDF can be thought of as a linear transformation, and hence a matrix $S$ acting on this vector: $\bm{\mathrm{p}'} = S\bm{\mathrm{p}}$. This matrix only needs to be calculated once for a given set of systematic parameter values, and can then use the same matrix on all the PDFs in the fit. Furthermore, when multiple systematics are applied, the matrix for each systematic can then be combined via matrix multiplication into one single ``detector response'' matrix. \texttt{OXO} uses the \texttt{Armadillo}~\cite{sandersonArmadilloTemplatebasedLibrary2016,sandersonUserFriendlyHybridSparse2018} % Armadillo software citation
linear algebra package for efficient matrix manipulation.

There is a problem that can arise when considering the impact of systematics near the edge of the analysis ROI. Many systematics such as shifts, scalings, and convolutions use information about the contents of nearby bins to determine the contents of a particular bin. However, for bins near the edge some of that information does not exist --- it has been lost to the cuts that define the ROI. This can lead to a bias in the generation of the modified PDFs, and therefore also the posterior distribution.

This is exemplified by the impact of an energy scale systematic on the energy distribution of PMT $\beta-\gamma$ events in the detector, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:energy_scaling_example}. Because the events seen for this process in the ROI are merely the high-energy tail, any systematic energy scaling $E'_{\textrm{reco}} := \alpha E_{\textrm{reco}}$ should have a large impact on the number of events observed at the low end of the ROI. However, given that the information about data below $E_{\textrm{min}}$ is lost to the ROI cuts, any energy scaling of $\alpha>1$ will not be applied correctly at all.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{6_SolarAnalysis/images/buffer_region_demonstration_PMT_beta_gammas.pdf}
    \caption[Demonstration of how to handle an energy scaling systematic correctly]
    {Demonstration of how to handle an energy scaling systematic correctly. The distribution of PMT $\beta-\gamma$ events in the analysis ROI is shown versus energy, both before and after an energy scaling of $\alpha = 1.01$ has been applied. If the distribution below \SI{2.5}{\MeV} is not known, then the scaled distribution is biased systematically. This is solved through the use of a buffer region, as indicated.}
    \label{fig:energy_scaling_example}
\end{figure}

The solution to this problem is defining a ``buffer region'' of bins on the edges of the ROI, which allow for tracking of events in and out of the ROI due to systematics, but are not considered when calculating the likelihood. This is also shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:energy_scaling_example}. After the scaling systematic is applied, although incorrect bin values are found in the buffer region, this is fine because the likelihood is no longer being calculated with those bins. Note that because of this modification, the normalisation parameters put into the model no longer represent the expected number of events in the ROI. Instead, they represent the number of events expected in both the ROI and buffer region, before any systematics have been applied.


\subsection{Including Oscillations in the Fit}\label{sec:osc_in_fit}
Within the analysis MCMC code, the process of neutrino oscillations are thought of as a \textit{de facto} systematic that acts only on the \beight{} $\nu_{e}$ and $\nu_{x}$ signal spectra. Three parameters relevant to the signal are floated within the MCMC fit: \dmsq{}, \tonetwo{}, and $\varphi_{\beight{}}=\Phi_{\ce{^{8}B}}^{\mathrm{meas}}/\Phi_{\ce{^{8}B}}$, the unoscillated \ce{^{8}B} neutrino flux relative to the expected rate. For the two signal PDFs, a third ``bookkeeping'' dimension is added on top of reconstructed energy and radius: the true neutrino energy, $E_{\nu}$. This is necessary to correctly apply oscillations, as the oscillation probability is a function of the neutrino's true energy, not the measured energy. Before the fit, these 3D PDFs are given normalisations corresponding to the expectation of the number of events for each type, $\nu_{e}$ and $\nu_{\mu,\tau}$, after cuts but before oscillations have been applied. Strictly speaking there should be zero $\nu_{\mu,\tau}$ events before neutrino oscillations: the pre-oscillation rate used here is the post-cut number of events expected if 100\% of the neutrinos oscillated to the $\nu_{\mu,\tau}$ type.

During the MCMC fit, for a given set of parameters $\bm{\theta} = \left(\dmsq{}, \tonetwo{}, \varphi_{\beight{}}\right)$ the following is performed to oscillate the signal PDFs. Firstly, the normalisations are scaled by the factor $\varphi_{\beight{}}$. Then, for each $E_{\nu}$ bin the survival probability $P_{ee}\left(E_{\nu}, \dmsq{}, \tonetwo{}\right)$ is calculated. Each bin then has their probability scaled by either $P_{ee}$ or $1-P_{ee}$, for $\nu_{e}$ and $\nu_{\mu,\tau}$ respectively. Within the structure of the \texttt{OXO} framework these bin-by-bin scaling are not immediately applied, but instead a matrix describing the impact of oscillations on each of the PDFs is made. Because the oscillation transformation is purely a bin-by-bin scaling, the resulting matrices are diagonal, with diagonal elements $\varphi_{\beight{}}\cdot P_{ee}\left(E_{\nu}, \dmsq{}, \tonetwo{}\right)$ or $\varphi_{\beight{}}\cdot\left(1-P_{ee}\left(E_{\nu}, \dmsq{}, \tonetwo{}\right)\right)$ for $\nu_{e}$ and $\nu_{\mu,\tau}$ respectively. After the oscillation matrix along with all other systematic matrices are applied to the signal PDFs, the PDFs are then marginalised over the $E_{\nu}$ dimension so that the signal PDFs match the dimensionality of all other PDFs.

Calculations of the survival probability are handled with \texttt{PSelmaa}, an algorithm written by Nuno Barros for SNO~\cite{barrosPrecisionMeasurementNeutrino2011}. % Nuno's thesis
This considers not only the neutrino oscillations through the vacuum of space between the Sun and Earth, but also the impact of matter effects in both the Sun and Earth. This can usually be a very computationally-intensive process, but \texttt{PSelmaa} takes advantage of the assumption that the solar oscillation parameters are in the so-called ``Large Mixing Angle'' regime, making the calculation much faster. As seen in Section~\ref{sec:nu_osc_evidence}, % ref chapter 1
previous solar oscillation experiments demonstrate that this assumption is reasonable. For this analysis, the standard MSW effect described in Chapter~\ref{chap:theory} is assumed with neutrinos obeying the Normal Hierarchy, with the Sun following the \texttt{B16\_GS98} metallicity model~\cite{vinyolesB16StandardSolar2018} % CITE
and the \texttt{PREM} model being used for the Earth~\cite{dziewonskiPreliminaryReferenceEarth1981}. % CITE
% Discussion of why these models and not others?

One final thing \texttt{PSelmaa} needs to know to calculate survival probabilities is the distribution of solar zenith angles during the data-taking. The solar zenith $\theta_{z}$ is the angle between the two following vectors: one going from the centre of the Earth through the centre of the SNO+ detector, and another starting from the detector's centre and pointing towards the Sun. As an example, if the Sun were ever to be vertically above the detector, both vectors would be along the vertical direction $\bm{\hat{z}}$ in detector coordinates, leading to a solar zenith angle of $\theta_{z}=0$. The position of the SNO+ detector on Earth, as well as the times at which the detector was live, determine the solar zenith angle distribution. If not accounted for, this can lead to a bias in the result of the analysis, as a preponderance of livetime taken at night would lead to a larger fraction of solar neutrinos having to pass through the bulk of the Earth to get to the detector, and hence the impact of the MSW effect would be greater.

Even after using the Large Mixing Angle approximation, having to call \texttt{PSelmaa} numerous times for every step in the MCMC algorithm would lead to exorbitant run times for the fitting. Therefore, a further approximation is made. Before running the MCMC fit, \texttt{PSelmaa} is used to calculate $P_{ee}$ over the necessary 3D space of parameters. To get a fine scan of this space, 101 $E_{\nu}$ values from \SI{1}{\MeV} to \SI{20}{\MeV}, 101 \dmsq{} values from \SI{3e-6}{\eV\squared} to \SI{1e-3}{\eV\squared}, and 151 values for \tonetwo{} from \ang{5} to \ang{65} were looked over. This 3D grid of $101\cdot101\cdot151$ $P_{ee}$ values is then written to disk, and loaded into memory for use during the fit as a lookup table. At run-time, as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm samples this 3D space the survival probability is estimated through a trilinear interpolation of the 3D grid loaded in: a version of linear interpolation for three dimensions.
% Discussion of minor systematic associated with linear interpolation?

    %  \begin{itemize}
        % \item Start with observational principle: changes in oscillation parameters lead to change in the energy spectrum of neutrinos elastically-scattering in the detector, and hence a change in the observed energy spectra of elastically-scattered electrons within the detector. Demonstrate basic impact on modifying $\Delta m^{2}_{21}$ and $\theta_{12}$.
        % \item Want to maximise the sensitivity to measuring these two parameters. Energy spectrum of signal is background-free above $\sim\SI{5}{\MeV}$, but rate is substantially larger at lower energies. If one can minimise backgrounds at the lower energies, then there should be hopes of obtaining a measurement with greater precision!
        % \item Set up analysis approach: a Bayesian analysis using MCMC. Explain why this was chosen at a high level first: allows for us to perform a relatively complex analysis with multidimensional PDFs, numerous backgrounds, systematics, constraints on parameters, all whilst allowing us to obtain well-defined measures of uncertainty on our final results.
        % \item Test statistic: binned extended log-likelihood. Explain why this is fundamentally the ``right''  test statistic to use. Allows for handling of constraints and systematics.
        % \item Give an overview of how an MCMC works. Key idea: exploring parameter space in such a way as to reproduce posterior density distribution. Clever! Helps to avoid ``curse of dimensionality'' that often arises in fits with numerous parameters. Must also explain how we work in a fundamentally Bayesian, not frequentist, statistical approach.
        % \item Explain background processes we'll be dealing with: can be distinguished by event topology, energy spectrum, and position distribution.
        % \item Explain cuts that I am using for the analysis. Demonstrate how these attempt to maximise our signal sensitivity. Leads nicely into choice of 2D fit in both energy and radius (cubed).
        % \item Describe implementation of neutrino oscillations within the fitting procedure: flat priors on the oscillation parameters, but a strong constraint from the solar flux. Explain choices of constraint that are possible. MCMC varies oscillation parameters and flux scaling factor, which then modifies the solar signal PDFs through a de-facto systematic that is a function of true neutrino energy, a 3\textsuperscript{rd} ``bookkeeping'' dimension in the signal's PDFs only. Neutrino oscillations simulated via PSelmaa, which accounts for MSW effect in both the Sun and the Earth. For computational speed, at run-time we actually use a lookup table with linear interpolation for the survival probability as a function of parameters.
        % \item Implementation of systematics: we handle them generally as linear transformations acting on the vector of bin data. Clever!
        % \item Which systematics do we expect to be particularly important for this analysis? Well, mismodelling in detector optics etc. can lead to changes in the measured energy spectrum of processes, which can be decomposed into an energy scale term and an energy smearing term to first order. Systematics also possible in the radial dimension (expected to be less important?)

\section{Analysis on Scintillator-Phase data}\label{sec:solar_analysis_results}
\subsection{Dataset and Livetime}\label{sec:solar_dataset_livetime}
The data used in this analysis was chosen to be scintillator phase data after the end of the PPO top-up campaign that completed in April 2022. Following an initial validation of the analysis tools was performed on data between 29\textsuperscript{th} April and 10\textsuperscript{th} May 2022~\cite{cookmanSolarOscillationAnalysis2023}, % cite presentation of my high-background results
data for the full analysis was chosen from runs taken after these dates. Not all data taken during this time was considered usable for this analysis, however: this is the role of \textit{run selection}. The Collaboration's `Preliminary Scintillator Gold' run selection list was used as the basis for this analysis. This run list requires:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The run type must be in `Physics', as opposed to running in calibration or maintenance;
    \item The run must last at least 30 minutes;
    \item Detector electronics must be working in a stable manner without any alarms, and with all crates online;
    \item There are no abnormal rates of tagged muons, and the OWL PMTs are correctly functioning;
    \item There are no unusual conditions from e.g. earthquakes, blasting activity in the mine, or loss of power. 
\end{itemize}
In the end, data for this analysis used `Gold' runs selected between 17\textsuperscript{th} May--30\textsuperscript{th} November 2022, run numbers 300733--306498. The raw livetime associated with this dataset was calculated by looking at the start and end times of each run using the detector's \SI{10}{\MHz} clock: 84.977 days.

Importantly, the livetime of the data actually used in the analysis ends up being somewhat less than this raw value. This is because two of the cuts used in the analysis (described in Section~\ref{sec:event_selection}), the muon tagger and the high-\texttt{nhit} event tagger, also veto events for a time period following a tagged event. This means that any events in such a time window are automatically thrown out of consideration for analysis. An algorithm was written to determine the loss of livetime from both of these tagging processes for all the runs selected in this analysis, allowing for the net livetime to be calculated. To ensure accuracy in the value of this lost livetime, the algorithm took care to handle any overlaps in the time veto windows. This ends up being a quite common occurrence, as tagged muon events and their followers often have a very high \texttt{nhit}. The net livetime was calculated to be 80.615 days. Data processing and simulations used RAT versions 7.0.8 and 7.0.9.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:osc_in_fit}, in order to account for the impact of the MSW effect through the Earth on $P_{ee}$, the solar zenith angular distribution of the dataset is needed. This was achieved by taking the recorded trigger time of each event within the dataset as given by the GPS-calibrated \SI{10}{\MHz} clock, determining the position of the Sun at that time, and then deriving the value of $\cos{\theta_{z}}$ given that solar position. The resulting distribution of $\cos{\theta_{z}}$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:solar_zenith_distribution}. The structure of this distribution are a result of the times of day and year of the runs selected for this analysis.

\subsection{Event Selection}\label{sec:event_selection}
Once the runs of processed data and matching MC have been selected, the next step was to perform cuts on both in order to obtain our analysis ROI. The full list of cuts used are shown in Table~\ref{tab:ev_selection}, most of which have already been explained in Section~\ref{sec:background_processes}.

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Cuts used in this analysis.}
    \label{tab:ev_selection}
\end{table}

Most of the other cuts used in this analysis that haven't yet been discussed come from handling differences between data and MC. In MC, it is possible to simulate an event but not have it trigger the detector. In this case, the stored index of that event (\texttt{evIndex}) will be less than zero. We never see these `events' in data of course, but they do need to be removed from simulation. On the flip side, there are types of events that we observe in the detector but do not simulate. Many of these events are caught during `data cleaning', which looks for a wide variety of problems in the data when the data is being processed. Any subset of the checks made during data cleaning can be chosen to consider in a given analysis by defining a specific `analysis mask'; a number that specifies for each of its binary digits whether to consider the data cleaning process associated with that bit. The mask chosen used in this analysis is the Collaboration's current standard for the scintillator phase, \texttt{0x2100000042c2}, which corresponds to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{00 cut}: Tags every event which has a GTID ending in 00 in hexadecimal, which is associated with a long-standing issue in the detector triggering system.
    \item \textbf{Junk cut}: Tags events that have channels with multiple recorded hits for that event. These are associated with so-called `orphaned' hits that the event building process doesn't know what to do with.
    \item \textbf{OWL cut}: Tags events that have at least three OWL PMTs hit, a sign that the event came from a cosmic-ray muon.
    \item \textbf{Polling cut}: Tags all events that occur during `polling', a detector monitoring process.
    \item \textbf{CAEN cut}: Tags all events that have missing CAEN trace data.
    \item \textbf{Muon cut}: Tags muon-like events.
    \item \textbf{Muon follower cut}: Tags all events coming up to \SI{20}{\second} after a tagged muon event.
\end{itemize}

Beyond the formal data cleaning cuts, a high-\texttt{nhit} veto was used to tag and remove various instrumental backgrounds which can generate large amounts of light in the detector. This method also catches any muons left untagged by the data cleaning mask. After any event with a sufficiently large number of hits, both that event and any following it for \SI{20}{\second} are removed. This method is likely to be fairly conservative, and there exist different methods for cutting flashers within data cleaning. However, these were originally coordinated for the water phase, and had not been updated for the scintillator phase at the time of writing.

The results of all these cuts can be seen for the data in Table~\ref{tab:data_cut_effs}. 654 out of the \num{18112495770} events within the dataset pass all cuts. These same cuts were also run over the MC, with results summarised in Table~\ref{tab:MC_cut_effs}. Important to note was the difference between the number of physics events simulated for a given process and the number of triggered events. The latter ends up being larger than the former for all processes discussed here, because a given physics event in the detector will often generate a retrigger event following the primary triggered event. Also shown in this table are the combined cut efficiencies for each process. This efficiency is defined as the number of triggered events that pass all cuts, divided by the number of simulated physics events for that process.

Variable bin widths in energy were chosen for this analysis: \SI{0.1}{\MeV} bins between \SI{2.5}{\MeV}--\SI{5.0}{\MeV}, \SI{0.25}{\MeV} bins between \SI{5.0}{\MeV}--\SI{13.0}{\MeV}, and a single energy bin between \SI{13.0}{\MeV}--\SI{14.0}{\MeV}. Four equally-spaced bins were used in the parameter $r_{3} = (r_{\mathrm{reco}}/R_{\mathrm{AV}})^{3}$ in the range $\SI{0}{\m}\le r_{\mathrm{reco}} < \SI{5.0}{\m}$. The $r_{3}$ parameter was used to allow for equal volume weighting for each radial bin.

\subsection{Expected Rates and their Constraints}\label{sec:exp_rates_constraints}
Because this analysis is dependent on deriving the shape and size of the \beight{} spectrum from the data observed, it is important to have expectations about the number of events expected to be seen within the dataset for each process, both signal and background. This is done in two stages: firstly, the expected rates for each process before any cuts applied is determined, along with any constraints. Then, by using the cut efficiencies calculated in the previous section, we can derive estimates for the expected number of events after cuts. When combined with a constraining uncertainty, this can be used as a prior within the MCMC fit. The resulting expected rates before and after cuts, along with any constraints being used, afer shown in Table~\ref{tab:MC_expected_rates_constraints}.

\subsubsection{\beight{} Signal}
Starting with the \beight{} signal, numerous theoretical predictions and experimental measurements have been made of the \beight{} flux. For this analysis, two different values have been used. The SSM predicts a relatively loose constraint of $\Phi_{\beight{}} = (5.46\pm 12\%)\times 10^{6}\,\si{\per\cm\squared\per\second}$~\cite{vinyolesB16StandardSolar2018}, % cite SSM flux
whereas a recent global fit of neutrino oscillation experiments by Bergstr\"{o}m \textit{et al} leads to a much stronger constraint of $\Phi_{\beight{}} = (5.16\,^{+2.5\%}_{-1.7\%})\times 10^{6}\,\si{\per\cm\squared\per\second}$~\cite{bergstromUpdatedDeterminationSolar2016}. % cite Bergstrom et al
We shall mainly use the latter result to both calculate the expected rate of the signal events in the detector, and the fractional uncertainties used to constrain this rate. The looser constraint coming from the SSM will be used for comparison.

To calculate the number of electrons within the liquid scintillator, we follow the method used in~\cite{inacioDataAnalysisWater2022}, % cite Ana Sofia's thesis
which uses the formula:
\begin{equation}
    n_{e} = \frac{\left(f_{\mathrm{LAB}}n_{\mathrm{LAB}} +
                        f_{\mathrm{PPO}}n_{\mathrm{PPO}}\right)
                  N_{A}M_{\mathrm{LAB}}}
                 {m}.
\end{equation}
Here, $f_{\mathrm{LAB}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{PPO}}$ are the fraction by weight of the LAB and PPO within the scintillator cocktail, respectively. Because this analysis is done over data taken during the scintillator phase with a PPO concentration of \SI{2.2}{\g} for every litre of LAB, these take values 99.744\% and 0.256\%, respectively. $n_{\mathrm{LAB}}$ and $n_{\mathrm{PPO}}$ are the mean number of electrons per molecule of LAB and PPO, respectively. PPO has the chemical formula \ce{C_{15}H_{11}NO}, leading to $n_{\mathrm{PPO}} = 116$. The LAB used in SNO+ has varying alkyl chain lengths, leading to a varying number of electrons per molecule. This distribution is known to have changed between batches of LAB made by the manufacturer, and is also impacted by the distillation process used during the purification of the LAB before it was put into the AV. At the time of writing, no final molecular breakdown has been made for the LAB within the detector; for now we shall use the breakdown provided here~\cite{lebeufLABCertificateAnalysis2020}, % cite LAB breakdown DocDB #7572
from a representative tanker truck of LAB: there $n_{\mathrm{LAB}} = 131.68$. Finally, $N_{A} = \SI{6.02e23}{\per\mol}$ is Avogadro's Constant, $M_{\mathrm{LAB}} = \SI{780.2}{\tonne}$ is the total mass of scintillator within a sphere of radius the size of the AV, and $m = \SI{235}{\g\per\mol}$ is the molecular weight of the scintillator. This leads to a value for the number of electron targets:
\begin{equation*}
    n_{e} = \num{2.63e32}\; \mathrm{electrons}.
\end{equation*}

We can modify Eq.~\ref{eq:solar_rate} to get an equation for the total rate of solar neutrino events by flavour, before oscillations or analysis cuts are considered:\
\begin{equation}
    R_{i} = \Phi_{\beight{}}n_{e}
                \int S_{\nu}\left(E_{\nu}\right)\sigma_{\nu_{i}}\left(E_{\nu}\right)\,dE_{\nu}.
\end{equation}
Note that for $i=\mu,\tau$, this rate corresponds to the interaction rate if 100\% of the neutrinos have flavour $\nu_{\mu,\tau}$.

Using the cross-section formula from Eq.~\ref{eq:enu_es_xsec}, the \beight{} spectral shape from~\cite{winterB8NeutrinoSpectrum2006}, and $\Phi_{\beight{}} = \SI{5.46e6}{\per\cm\squared\per\second} \left(\SI{5.16e6}{\per\cm\squared\per\second}\right)$, we expect a rate before considering oscillations or cuts of:
\begin{equation*}
    R_{i} = 
    \begin{cases}
        2743.2 (2592.5)\; \text{events/yr} & \quad \text{for } i = e,\\
        489.7 (462.8)\;  \text{events/yr} & \quad \text{for } i = \mu,\tau.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
In the above rates, we have included an additional volume correction factor of 1.0139, because in MC events are simulated within the neck of the AV in addition to the main spherical bulk~\cite{caravacaValidationSNOProduction2019}. % cite Javi, DocDB 5519

\subsubsection{Internal Uranium- and Thorium-Chain Backgrounds}
As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:u_th_internals}, \ce{^{214}Bi-Po} and \ce{^{212}Bi-Po} decays, coming from the \ce{^{238}U} and \ce{^{232}Th} decay chains respectively, are capable of generating distinctive delayed coincidence events. Rafael Hunt-Stokes was able to use a series of cuts to isolate both types of coincidence signals~\cite{hunt-stokesUraniumThoriumBackground2022}, % cite Rafa's tech note?
looking at coincidence signals within the same \SI{5.0}{\m} FV as my analysis. After correcting for his cut efficiencies, he obtained a derived rate in the whole detector of~\cite{hunt-stokesPrivateCommunication2023}: % cite Rafa
\begin{equation*}
    \text{BiPo rate} = 
    \begin{cases}
        0.94\; \text{events/hour} & \quad \text{for } ^{212}\text{Bi-Po},\\
        6.06\; \text{events/hour} & \quad \text{for } ^{214}\text{Bi-Po}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
These rates assume a uniform concentration of \ce{^{222}Rn} and \ce{^{220}Rn} throughout the detector: this is how internal backgrounds are simulated by default in \texttt{RAT}. However, it has been shown that this is not at all the case within SNO+; radon ingress from the AV neck propagates through the bulk of the detector via convection currents induced by the thermal gradient present throughout the detector~\cite{wilsonThermallydrivenScintillatorFlow2023}. % Cite John wilson's paper, JoshW's & Rafa's tagging
This radon ingress also breaks the secular equilibrium of the two decay chains, so that one can no longer make straightforward predictions about rates for decays in the chains above radon. Fortunately for this analysis, Table~\ref{tab:MC_cut_effs} showed that the cut efficiencies for \ce{^{228}Ac} and \ce{^{234m}Pa} decays, both in their respective decay chain above radon, are negligible. This means that even if their decay rates were much greater than what would be predicted from the tagged BiPo rates, a negligible number of events are expected for both in the livetime of the dataset considered in this analysis.

The combination of broad coincidence tagging as well as using an in-window BiPo classifier cut ensures that the expected rate of BiPo events that survive all the cuts is 1.5 and 2.5 for \ce{^{212}Bi-Po} and \ce{^{214}Bi-Po}, respectively. Because the branching ratio of \ce{^{212}Bi\to^{208}Tl} is 36\%, and the branching ratio of \ce{^{214}Bi\to^{210}Tl} is 0.021\%~\cite{martinNuclearDataSheets2007,shamsuzzohabasuniaNuclearDataSheets2014}, % cite some table of decays
after considering the cut efficiencies in this analysis we expect 512.4 internal \ce{^{208}Tl} and 1.1 internal \ce{^{210}Tl} events.

In theory, the non-uniformity of all the radon-induced backgrounds could impact the results of the oscillation analysis. However, the rates of each after cuts have been applied mean that only the internal \ce{^{208}Tl} could plausibly have any effect. For this particular background, each slice of the binned PDF in $r_{3}$ was allowed to float independently, with no constraints. The other three related backgrounds considered in the fit (\ce{^{210}Tl}, \ce{^{212}Bi-Po}, and \ce{^{214}Bi-Po}) did not have this splitting applied to them. A loose 25\% constraint on each of these three processes' rates was applied, to account for the current uncertainty in the calculation of R. Hunt-Stokes' tagging efficiency.

\subsubsection{\alphan{} Reactions}
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:alphans}, \alphan{} reactions are induced by $\alpha$-particles generated in the detector. In the SNO+ scintillator phase, the dominant source of $\alpha$-particles are decays of \ce{^{210}Po} located both within the scintillator and on the AV surfaces. Because of substantial quenching by the scintillator, the reconstructed energy of the \ce{^{210}Po} $\alpha$ events fall substantially below $E_{\textrm{min}}$. The rate of the internal and surface \ce{^{210}Po} events have been tracked throughout the scintillator phase by Serena Riccetto and Shengzhao Yu, respectively.

Within the \SI{5}{\m} FV, S. Riccetto measured a total of \num{1.60e8} \ce{^{210}Po} events over the runs considered for this analysis~\cite{riccettoPrivateCommunication2023,riccettoFullFillInternal2023}. % cite Serena (private comm?)
Assuming the internal rate of these events are uniform throughout the scintillator, this leads to a total rate of \num{2.78e8} events for all the scintillator. After using a conversion rate of \num{6e-8} neutrons generated per $\alpha$ on \ce{^{13}C} in liquid scintillator~\cite{morton-blakeFirstMeasurementReactor2021,lozzaNeutronSourcesBackgrounds2015}, % where did this come from?
we can derive an expected number of internal \alphan{} events before cuts to be 17. However, because a coincidence cut is used in this analysis, the vast majority of these should be removed, leading to merely 0.009 events expected after cuts.

Similarly, S. Yu measured the surface \ce{^{210}Po} rate to vary between \SIrange{2}{5}{\Bq\per\square\metre} over the time period of this analysis as well as a function of height in the detector~\cite{yuAVSurfacePo2102023}. % cite Shengzhao's work
Using the midpoint value of \SI{3.5}{\Bq\per\square\metre}, one can derive an expected rate of 554.4 surface \alphan{} events occurring over the dataset's livetime, before cuts. Once again, the coincidence cut as well as the FV cut removes the vast majority of these events, so that only 0.07 events are expected after all cuts have been applied. Because both classes of \alphan{} events have negligible expected rates in our dataset, they were not included within the MCMC fit.

\subsubsection{External Backgrounds}
During the water phase of SNO+, an analysis of the rates of the external backgrounds was performed by Tony Zummo~\cite{zummoExternalBackgroundBox2022}. % cite Zummo's externals results
The results of this analysis are shown in Table~\ref{tab:externals_rates_zummo}, giving the measured rates as a fraction of the nominal values given in~\cite{andringaCurrentStatusFuture2016}. % cite white paper.
Although the statistical uncertainty for these measurements were quite small, the total systematic uncertainty was substantial because T. Zummo's analysis involved looking at events in the tail of energy distributions, so that any uncertainty in the energy scale systematic had an outsized impact on the number of events observed within that energy window. These measured rates and their systematic uncertainties were used to predict the expected rate and constrain the external backgrounds in this scintillator phase solar analysis. For the AV, ropes, and PMTs, this seems reasonable as we do not expect there to be any substantial change in these backgrounds between the phases. The exception to this is the external water, where various aspects of the water purification process over the years since T. Zummo's analysis dataset was taken~\cite{kaptanogluFirstLookExternal2023}. Because of this, the water phase measured rate was used as a starting point for the fit, but no constraint was applied.

\end{table}

Before the expected number of triggered events can be calculated for each external background process, two subtleties must be dealt with. Firstly, MC production of the externals did not include the hold-up ropes at the time of performing the analysis. This is not a major problem, because the hold-up ropes are of substantially lower mass than the hold-down ropes, and also their average radius from the centre of the detector is much larger. This means that the expected rate of events from the hold-up ropes that manage to reconstruct inside the FV should be sub-dominant to their hold-down counterparts. For the purposes of this thesis, the combined rate for both kinds of ropes were calculated, with the overall cut efficiency and derived PDFs coming from just the hold-down ropes.

Secondly, because the attenuation length of a \SI{2.6}{\MeV} $\gamma$ particle is \SI{23}{\cm} in water~\cite{bergerXCOMPhotonCross2009,heintzelmanSurvivalRadiiPSUP2012}, % cite xsec database (see W.Heintzelman DocDBs!)
the vast majority of external backgrounds which start from a substantial distance away from the AV do not generate $\gamma$s that make it into the scintillator. As a result, an enormous amount of computational resources could be wasted on simulating events that never get into the ROI. To work around this, PMT $\beta-\gamma$ events are modelled as \SI{2.6}{\MeV} $\gamma$s generated at a radius of \SI{6.2}{\m} (just outside the AV), pointing radially inwards. Making some basic assumptions about these events, one can derive the expected survival rate of these $\gamma$ particles as a function of radius~\cite{heintzelmanSurvivalRadiiPSUP2012,heintzelmanAngularDistributionSurviving2013}, % cite Heintzelman #1712, 1729
which leads to a correction factor of \num{1.17e-6}.

Similarly, simulations of background events in the external water and ropes are restricted from starting beyond certain maximum radii depending on the specific process, such that there remains a negligible impact on the fraction of simulated events that actually deposit any energy into the scintillator. This leads to rate correction factors of 0.35 and 0.50 for external water \ce{^{214}Bi} and \ce{^{208}Tl} events, as well as 0.50 and 0.35 for hold-down and hold-up ropes~\cite{inacioUsingSmallerShell2019}. % cite Ana Sofia's DocDB #5154

% \subsubsection{Cosmogenic Backgrounds}
% The final background in consideration is decays of the cosmogenically-induced isotope \ce{^{11}C}. Extrapolating from the KamLAND experiment, we expect before cuts 889 of these events a year~\cite{}. % cite KamLAND, someone in SNO+ who's done this?

\subsection{Systematics}
There are a number of systematic effects in the analysis that could possibly have some impact on the resulting posterior densities of \tonetwo{} and \dmsq{}. Consideration of these effects is important to ensure that the uncertainty in the measurement is not underestimated. However, we shall find in Section~\ref{sec:solar_projections} that for this dataset, the analysis is statistically-limited, and so it is not necessary to perform exhaustive measurements to determine the contribution of all possible systematic contributions. Instead, the focus shall be on the subset of the systematics that can plausibly have the most impact on the final measurement.

In this analysis, the measurement of the oscillation parameters is based on the fitted shape and normalisation of the \beight{} signal energy spectrum. Therefore, for a systematic effect to have an impact on the final measurement it must first impact the fit of the signal PDF. One straightforward way this could occur is for some background events to be misattributed as signal events within the fit (or vice versa). If the rates of signal and background processes are strongly constrained to incorrect values, then this could easily happen. This could be a result of either getting the rate pre-cuts or the cut efficiencies incorrect. In this analysis, the strongest constraint on the rate of events comes from the global fit constraint of $\Phi_{\beight{}}$. Because of this, the fit will also be run with the looser SSM constraint on the signal flux as a means of comparison.

Another class of systematic effects that can plausibly have a substantial impact come from the mismodelling of the detector response, particularly on the reconstructed energy and radius, as they are the observables used within the fit. The most important of these for this analysis is a global mismodelling of the energy calibration by some linear factor known as the energy scale, $\alpha$: $E_{\mathrm{reco}}\to\alpha E_{\mathrm{reco}}$.

Because of this importance, it is worthwhile constraining this $\alpha$ parameter. This can be done by comparing the reconstructed energy distributions of \ce{^{214}BiPo} events tagged by R. Hunt-Stokes~\cite{hunt-stokesPrivateCommunication2023} % cite Rafa?
in the dataset to the equivalent production MC, in the same \SI{5}{\m} FV. For a given $\alpha$, the energies of the tagged \ce{^{214}Bi} in MC were scaled by $\alpha$, and then compared to the equivalent (unscaled) distribution in data, via a log-likelihood ratio $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Bi}}$:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Bi}} = 
    \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\mathrm{bins}}}
        n_{i}^{\mathrm{data}}\ln{\frac{n_{i}^{\mathrm{MC}}}{N_{\mathrm{MC}}}}.
\end{equation}
Here, $n_{i}^{\mathrm{data}}$ and $n_{i}^{\mathrm{MC}}$ are the number of events for data and (scaled) MC in energy bin $i$, with $N_{\mathrm{bins}}$ being the total number of bins and $N_{\mathrm{MC}}$ being the total number of tagged events in MC. To account for the edge effects discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sys_in_fit_theory}, the first and last bins in energy were used as buffers and not considered in calculation of $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Bi}}$.

Values of $\alpha$ were scanned over, generating a log-likelihood distribution. In the usual way, a constraint on $\alpha$ was obtained by obtaining the energy scaling factor which maximises the log-likelihood, followed by looking for the $\alpha$ values with values of $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Bi}}$ less than the maximum by 1/2. The constraint was found to be $\alpha = 0.9969\pm0.0022$, with the data and scaled MC at the best fit value of $\alpha$ shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bi214_escale_calibration}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{6_SolarAnalysis/images/rafael_tagged_bi214_data_vs_mc_energy_comparison_resized.pdf}
    \caption[Comparison of tagged \ce{^{214}Bi} reconstructed energy distributions between data and MC]
    {Comparison of tagged \ce{^{214}Bi} reconstructed energy distributions between data and MC, after MC has been scaled by the best-fit factor $\alpha = 0.9969$.}
    \label{fig:bi214_escale_calibration}
\end{figure}

To handle energy scaling as a systematic in this analysis, we allow the energy scale to be floated within the MCMC fit, with the constraint given above. The first and last energy bin of the MCMC fit were used as buffer bins to let this floating occur; this allows for the energy scale to float in the range $\frac{13}{14}\leq\alpha\leq\frac{2.6}{2.5}$.

In addition to a global energy scaling, it is possible that the resolution of the energy reconstruction could be systematically off. Because of the effects discussed in Section~\ref{sec:solar_obs_principle}, changes to the oscillation parameters only impact the observed signal distribution over a broad range of energies. This means that mismodelling the energy resolution of the detector is only liable to have an impact on the measurement if that mismodelling is substantial. However, by looking again at Fig.~\ref{fig:bi214_escale_calibration} we see that there appears to be a good qualitative match of the energy resolution between data and MC for the tagged \ce{^{214}Bi} events. As a result, the systematic effect of additional energy smearing will not be considered in this thesis.

Similar to the systematics in reconstructed energy, there are also systematics possible in reconstructed position. These can be decomposed into three kinds of systematic: radial scaling, radial resolution, and position bias along each coordinate axis. The dominant effect that these systematics will have on the PDFs is to change their normalisations. Because we are floating all normalisations within the MCMC fit, and the normalisation constraints of almost all PDFs are relative large, we expect the impact of these systematics to be sub-dominant.

Finally, there can also be mismodelling of the radial distributions for given processes in MC compared to data. For example, it is known that the internal \ce{^{208}Tl} events are non-uniform as a function of radius; this is why the normalisation of each radial slice for this background is floated independently. The external backgrounds can also plausibly have PDF shape systematics, especially if the assumptions made to model them (such as the use of simulation shells) are not fully accurate. These shape systematics can also arise from the lack of statistics in the PDFs used to model them: as an example, Table~\ref{tab:MC_cut_effs} shows that only 62 external water \ce{^{214}Bi} events are used in the creation of the associated PDF. Handling this type of modelling uncertainties for the external backgrounds is not considered in this thesis.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Incorrect constraints of signal and background rates, which could arise from a systematic error in either the expected rate before cuts, or the overall cut efficiency.
%     \item Systematic errors in the reconstructed energy. To first order, this can be decomposed into two parts. Firstly, there could be a linear scaling of the energy by some energy scaling factor $\alpha$, i.e. $E_{\mathrm{reco}}\to\alpha E_{\mathrm{reco}}$. There could also be a difference in the resolution of the energy reconstruction.
%     \item Systematic errors in the reconstructed position. Similar to the above, this can also be decomposed into a radial scaling systematic, radial resolution systematic, and biases along each coordinate axis.

\subsection{Results}
\subsubsection{Fit Validation}
In theory, the convergence of the sampled distribution within an MCMC fit to the posterior density distribution is guaranteed to eventually occur, regardless of the specific shape of the multivariate Gaussian proposal distribution. However, the speed of this convergence is highly dependent on the widths of the proposal distribution. This is very important as in practice we can only run the MCMC fit for a finite amount of time. For a given parameter within the fit, if the associated width (also known as the step size) in the proposal distribution is too large, then the vast majority of proposals will be to points in the parameter space where the log-likelihood is less than before, and so these proposals will be consistently rejected. Alternatively,  if the width is chosen too small, the acceptance rate of the chain will be very high, but too much time will be spent for the chain to go from sampling one point in the space to another.

By choosing sensible width parameters for the proposal distribution, as well as running the chain for as long as possible, one can attempt to maximise the ``effective sample size'' of the MCMC fit. It has been shown that, for a wide variety of situations, an appropriate size for the width of a given parameter is the standard deviation of the true posterior density distribution~\cite{gelmanChapter11Basics2013}. % cite appropriate
Because knowing this posterior density distribution is precisely the aim of the whole MCMC procedure, this can make choosing these widths challenging in practice. In this analysis, an iterative approach was used: an MCMC fit was first run using width parameters that were guessed. Once this fit completed, the resulting sampled distribution marginalised onto each fit parameter were looked at to find approximately the magnitude of their standard deviations. This then informed the widths chosen for the next MCMC fit. This process was repeated until the autocorrelation of the sampled distribution for each fit parameter appeared to be minimal; this is an indication that the effective sample size has been maximised. A chain length of \num{1000000} steps was found to be sufficient to obtain large enough effective sample sizes for this analysis.

In order to guard against the possibility of a given chain missing some important part of the parameter space because of its starting position, 100 chains were run simultaneously. The initial positions of each in the parameter space were chosen randomly according to the overall prior distribution. Fig.~\ref{fig:params_vs_step_plots} shows the sampled values for four different parameters in a given chain, after the tuning of the width parameters had been completed.

Given some initial start point in the parameter space, a given chain will typically take some time in finding where the region of greatest likelihood is. This leads to an initial set of steps where the chain moves a large distance in the parameter space in the same direction, so that the autocorrelation of the chain in this period is substantial. These initial samples are not representative of the actual posterior density distribution: as a result, in this analysis the first \num{100000} steps of each chain were declared as a ``burn-in'' period. This number of steps for the burn-in was motivated in part by looking at auto-correlation plots for the MCMC chains, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:auto_corr}. By the time the number of steps differed by \num{100000}, the autocorrelation of parameters and the log-likelihood itself of each chain was at zero, indicating the likelihood evaluations in the chains were independent when they differed by at least \num{100000} steps. The overall set of samples used to approximate the posterior density distribution corresponds to collection of all sampled points on all the chains, after burn-in.

\subsubsection{Oscillation Fit Results}
Now that there is confidence in the convergence of the MCMC fit to the posterior density distribution, we can look at this distribution to obtain the results of this analysis. Fig.~\ref{fig:nuisance_params_marged} shows the posterior density distribution, marginalised onto each parameter of the fit other than the two oscillation parameters. We can see that each marginalised distribution appears smooth, another qualitative indication of a sufficient effective sample size in the MCMC fit. For each 1D distribution, the bin centre associated with the HPD has been indicated, and the vertical band indicates the Bayesian 1$\sigma$ CI for that parameter. Also shown in these plots is the prior distribution for each of the parameters, for comparison.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{6_SolarAnalysis/images/posterior_densities_plot_no_osc.pdf}
    \caption[Marginalised 1D posterior density distributions for all non-oscillation parameters.]
    {Marginalised 1D posterior density distributions for all non-oscillation parameters, shown in blue. The HPD and 1$\sigma$ Bayesian CI are shown for each parameter. Also shown in dashed red are the associated prior distributions.}
    \label{fig:nuisance_params_marged}
\end{figure}

For a number of the parameters, the posterior distributions are more strongly peaked than their associated priors. This indicates that there was enough information in the dataset further constrain those parameters. One such parameter is the rate of the external water \ce{^{214}Bi}. The resulting measurement of this is $34.1^{+18.5}_{-18.9}$ events in the dataset. This is 10 times larger than the expected rate shown in Table~\ref{tab:MC_expected_rates_constraints}, providing good evidence for a change in the level of this particular background relative to the water phase. In contrast, all other external backgrounds have HPDs consistent with their prior expected values.

Another set of parameters that have been well-constrained in the fit are the normalisations of each of the internal \ce{^{208}Tl} slices. As expected, slices corresponding to larger radii have a greater fitted rate, with the number of events measured in the outermost radial slice to be twice that of the innermost one. However, the posteriors of the other internal \ce{^{238}U}- and \ce{^{232}Th}-chain are the same as their priors, indicating there was no evidence from data within the fit to constrain those processes any further. Similarly, the posteriors of the energy scale parameter and $\Phi_{\beight{}}$ only show very mild differences with their strong priors.

If instead of looking only at the 1D marginalised distributions of each parameter we look at the equivalent 2D distributions for every combination of parameters, we can generate a table of correlation coefficients. This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:corr_plots_params}. From this, we can see that there is some clear anti-correlation between a number of the external backgrounds. This seems intuitive: the PDFs for many of these external backgrounds are similar, and so the fit struggles to distinguish between them.

\begin{figure}

    {Correlation matrix between all parameters in the MCMC fit.}
    \label{fig:corr_plots_params}
\end{figure}

The only other pair of parameters which have a substantial correlation between one another are the two oscillation parameters. Fig.~\ref{fig:2d_osc_param_posterior} shows their 2D marginalised posterior distribution, along with contours for a number of Bayesian CIs. Because the priors on both oscillation parameters are uniform, this can be directly converted into the log-likelihood ratio $\ln{L_{R}}$ for a given bin, where $L_{R} = p/p_{max}$: $p$ is the posterior density of a given bin in the 2D space, and $p_{max}$ is the posterior density of the HPD bin, equivalent to the bin with the maximum likelihood. This allows for Frequentist CI to be derived as well. For this plot, the HPD is at $\tonetwo{} = \ang{34.1}, \dmsq{} = \SI{1.80e-5}{\eV\squared}$.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{6_SolarAnalysis/images/steve_style_contours.png}

Also shown, in shades of brown, are the Bayesian CIs.}
    \label{fig:2d_osc_param_posterior}
\end{figure}

As can be seen from this plot, the fit has been able to successfully constrain \tonetwo{} to some success. However, beyond a value of \SI{5e-4}{\eV\squared}, the posterior density appears flat as a function of \dmsq{}. This implies that this dataset provides little ability to reject the possibility of large values of \dmsq{}.

Given this lack of constraining power on \dmsq{}, it is reasonable to only obtain a measurement for \tonetwo{}. The result of marginalising over \dmsq{} to obtain the 1D posterior distribution in \tonetwo{} is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1d_theta_12_posterior}. From this, we can obtain a measurement of:
\begin{equation*}
    \left|\tonetwo{} + n\cdot180\right|^{\circ} = 38.9^{\circ+8.0^{\circ}}_{\phantom{\circ}-7.9^{\circ}}.
\end{equation*}
Here, the HPD has been estimated by fitting a quadratic function to the peak of the posterior distribution, and the uncertainties by obtaining the Bayesian $1\sigma$ CI. For comparison, the NuFit 5.1 global fit results have~\cite{estebanFateHintsUpdated2020}: % cite NuFit
\begin{equation*}
    \left|\tonetwo{} + n\cdot180\right|^{\circ} = 33.44^{\circ+0.77^{\circ}}_{\phantom{\circ}-0.74^{\circ}}.
\end{equation*}
As can be seen, the measurement made in this thesis is consistent with the global fit value, although with a substantially larger uncertainty. This is not surprising, given the limited statistics of the 80.6 days of data used.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{6_SolarAnalysis/images/theta_12_comparison_flux_constraint_corrected_tagging_2_mobins.pdf}
    \caption[Comparison of 1D posterior density distribution marginalised onto \tonetwo{} for different flux constraints]

    \label{fig:1d_theta_12_posterior}
\end{figure}

The fact that the measured value of \tonetwo{} is somewhat above the global fit value also has a reasonable explanation. Looking back at Fig.~\ref{fig:2d_osc_param_posterior}, we find that the preferred values of \tonetwo{} for large \dmsq{} are somewhat greater on average than for \dmsq{} values close to the global fit value of \SI{7.4e-5}{\eV\squared}. As a result, the final value quoted for \tonetwo{} is dependent on our choice of the prior distribution for \dmsq{}: this is an inevitable result of using a Bayesian framework for this analysis. We can see the impact of choosing a less conservative prior for \dmsq{} by ignoring all sampled points with $\dmsq{} \geq \SI{5e-4}{\eV\squared}$, say. The resulting measurement of \tonetwo{} becomes:
\begin{equation*}
    \left|\tonetwo{} + n\cdot180\right|^{\circ} = 36.4^{\circ+8.0^{\circ}}_{\phantom{\circ}-7.8^{\circ}}.
\end{equation*}
Although there is negligible change to the uncertainty of the measurement, this change in prior shifts the HPD value down by \ang{2.5}, in the direction of the global fit value.

Also shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2d_osc_param_posterior} is the posterior density for \tonetwo{} if the looser SSM flux constraint is used. Under these conditions, the measurement becomes:
\begin{equation*}
    \left|\tonetwo{} + n\cdot180\right|^{\circ} = 39.0^{\circ+9.8^{\circ}}_{\phantom{\circ}-9.6^{\circ}}.
\end{equation*}
Using this constraint has little impact on the HPD value, but does increase the uncertainty by $\sim\ang{1.8}$. This gives an indication of the extent to which the strong global flux constraint allows \tonetwo{} to be constrained on its own, without any information from the dataset.

One could na\"{i}vely expect that the point in parameter space where each fit parameter corresponds to the HPD value obtained in the above 1D marginalisation would correspond to the maximum likelihood. This is not the case, because of the correlations between parameters in the fit. Because an MCMC fit does not actually attempt to directly find this maximum likelihood point, deciding on the overall `best-fit' point in parameter space is a little ambiguous. For this analysis, the sampled point in all of the chains which had the greatest log-likelihood was declared as the best-fit point. A comparison between the parameter values obtained at the HPD of the 1D marginalisations to the maximum likelihood point is shown in Table~\ref{tab:fit_params_comparison}.

Using the maximal likelihood fit parameters, the comparison of data to MC is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:solar_data_mc_slices_comparison}. We see that the \beight{} signal distribution only dominates above \SI{5}{\MeV}, as well as at low energies for the first two radial slices. This is because for larger radii, external backgrounds become the dominant processes in the \SIrange{2.5}{2.8}{\MeV} region. Between \SIrange{3}{5}{\MeV}, at all radii the internal \ce{^{208}Tl} shows a clear peak well above the \beight{} signal. Qualitatively, the MC appears to give a good fit to the data.

\section{Sensitivity Projections}\label{sec:solar_projections}
Given the limited statistics used in the dataset analysed in Section~\ref{sec:solar_analysis_results}, the question of how much better we could measure the solar oscillation parameters with more data naturally arises. In particular, it is worthwhile knowing the expected sensitivity of this analysis as a function of livetime, and hence whether SNO+ could eventually make a world-leading measurement of \tonetwo{} via \beight{} neutrinos. Furthermore, it is useful to find out to what extent improvements such as additional background reduction could help the measurement.

To perform these sensitivity projections, the same analysis method was employed as with the real dataset. However, for each projection scenario a fake ``Asimov'' dataset was generated. This was a 2D histogram binned in the same way as the MC PDFs, corresponding to the total expected rate of all signal and background processes. Because the same PDFs were used to build both the MC and fake dataset, the maximum likelihood should occur when the fit parameters are identical to those which generated the fake dataset. Although this method of performing sensitivity projections leads to the slightly odd situation of having non-integer numbers of events in the bins of the fake dataset, it has been shown that this approach allows us to estimate the median sensitivity of a scenario~\cite{cowanAsymptoticFormulaeLikelihoodbased2011}. % cite https://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.1727.pdf, maybe more?

The assumptions used to make the fake datasets are as follows. To begin with, no cuts were changed between the main analysis and this projection, and the same PDFs were used in both. Furthermore, the \beight{} rate was determined by the same global fit flux value and neutrino oscillation parameters used in the rest of this analysis. Because some of the dataset used in the main analysis was taken during a time of known elevated \ce{^{238}U}- and \ce{^{232}Th}-chain backgrounds, R. Hunt-Stokes provided an additional estimate of the \ce{^{214}Bi-Po} and \ce{^{212}Bi-Po} rates in the \SI{5.0}{\metre} FV for only the period of the dataset where the internal background levels had stabilised. Those rates went from 6.06 events per hour before excluding the higher background period down to 4.87 events per hour for the \ce{^{214}Bi-Po}, and from 0.94 events per hour down to 0.89 events per hour. These relative changes for the two background chains were used to scale the rates from their expectation in the original dataset. For the internal \ce{^{208}Tl}, the rate of each slice relative to one another was taken from their fitted HPD values in the original analysis, with the absolute value of those rates scaled by $0.89/0.94$.

External backgrounds were in general set to the rates expected from T. Zummo, as described in Section~\ref{sec:exp_rates_constraints}. The exceptions were the backgrounds from the external water: for the \ce{^{208}Tl} component, the nominal rate without T. Zummo's correction factor was used. For the \ce{^{214}Bi} component, the higher rate as given by the fitted HPD value was used instead. The same constraints on all the rates were used as in the main analysis. For the energy scale parameter, because no additional systematics were applied to the Asimov dataset the true and expected value of $\alpha$ was set to 1, with the same uncertainty of $\pm0.0022$ as before.

Using this baseline set of assumptions, fake datasets were generated and fit over a series of livetime scenarios between 150 days and 5 years. The results of these MCMC fits, in terms of the 2D and 1D posterior densities for the oscillation parameters are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:2d_posteriors_projections} and \ref{fig:1d_posteriors_projections}. Note that the length of burn-in was increased to \num{250000} steps for these projections to ensure the convergence of all chains. As can be seen, by $\sim$2 years of livetime, there is sufficient evidence to confidently reject large \dmsq{} values above \SI{2e-4}{\eV\squared}. This leads to a fairly substantial decrease in uncertainty as well as less bias in the 1D HPD value for \tonetwo{}. There does remain some bias, however: this is because of the non-Gaussian ``boomerang'' structure seen in the 2D posterior density plots.

\end{figure}

The general story told by these projections is that, assuming the same conditions and analysis, increasing the livetime of the dataset will lead to a substantial improvement to the precision of the measurement of \tonetwo{}, as well as the beginnings of a measurement of \dmsq{}. However, after $\sim$3 years of livetime the rate of progress slows down somewhat.

The choices of assumptions for this baseline set of projections were deliberately chosen to be fairly conservative. However, they do not account for the loading of BisMSB and TeLS into the detector that is likely to occur in the coming years. For BisMSB, the main impact is expected to be a dramatic increase in the observed light yield in the detector, leading to a smaller energy resolution and hence improved measurement~\cite{albaneseSNOExperiment2021}. % cite something
Once the TeLS is also loaded, the observed light yield will likely decrease back down to levels similar to that of the current LABPPO. One of the biggest expected impact of the Te phase on this analysis will instead be to the background levels within the detector: the target rate of \ce{^{238}U}-chain backgrounds in the Te phase is $\sim$100 times that of the scintillator phase~\cite{andringaCurrentStatusFuture2016}. % cite target level backgrounds

Because of this, two further scenarios were considered over a period of 1 year of livetime. In one, the internal \ce{^{238}U}- and \ce{^{232}Th}-chain backgrounds were raised to the nominal level expected during the Te-loaded phase~\cite{kroupovaImprovingSensitivityNeutrinoless2020}. % cite tereza
Unique to the Te phase will be a number of other background processes. These include $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay as well as cosmogenic isotopes created from the spallation of Te nuclei. Because the Q-value of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay for \ce{^{130}Te} is \SI{2.53}{\MeV}, only a tiny fraction of those events should be expected to make it above this analysis' \SI{2.5}{\MeV} energy threshold. When the cuts described in Table~\ref{tab:ev_selection} were run over the production of $2\nu\beta\beta$ MC made for the dataset used in the above analysis, no events survived. For the cosmogenics, assuming that the purification of the TeLS works as expected, less than one cosmogenic event of any kind is expected in the \onbb{} ROI in a year~\cite{kroupovaImprovingSensitivityNeutrinoless2020}. % cite Tereza
Because of this, both of these additional backgrounds have been ignored for this scenario.

In the other background scenario, the external water backgrounds were set to the level measured by T. Zummo in the water phase, and the internal \ce{^{208}Tl} were reduced by a factor of 10. This latter scenario reflects the possibility of better control of the radioactivity in the external water, as well as a way of using new analysis methods to cut out 90\% of the internal \ce{^{208}Tl} events.

The results of running these two scenarios can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:osc_plots_low_vs_hi_backs}. Unsurprisingly, the $1\sigma$ CI for \tonetwo{} is wider when backgrounds are greater, and thinner in the lower background scenario. However, the magnitudes of the change in width are somewhat different. For the high backgrounds case, the width only increases by 2\%. This implies that the higher internal backgrounds expected during the Te phase should not, on their own, substantially hamper the sensitivity of the measurement of \tonetwo{}. With lower external water and internal \ce{^{208}Tl} backgrounds, it appears that sensitivity improvements $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ are achievable. This is because, over 1 year of livetime, the statistical uncertainties present in the signal process still dominate.

\section{Summary and Suggestions for Further Work}\label{sec:solar_summary}
In this chapter, a full analysis for measuring the solar neutrino oscillation parameters via \beight{} neutrinos was built and demonstrated on SNO+ scintillator-phase data. Using 80.6 days of livetime, assuming the global fit constraint on the \beight{} flux of $\Phi_{\beight{}} = (5.16\,^{+2.5\%}_{-1.7\%})\times 10^{6}\,\si{\per\cm\squared\per\second}$~\cite{bergstromUpdatedDeterminationSolar2016}, % cite Bergstrom et al
the oscillation parameter \tonetwo{} was measured to be $\left|\tonetwo{} + n\cdot180\right|^{\circ} = 38.9^{\circ+8.0^{\circ}}_{\phantom{\circ}-7.9^{\circ}}$.

Furthermore, assuming an identical analysis approach and similar detector conditions to those seen in the above dataset, the precision of this measurement is liable to improve by a factor of 2 in under 2 years of total livetime. This is partly because there become enough statistics to confidently reject large values of \dmsq{} above $\sim\SI{1.5e-4}{\eV\squared}$.

Of course, major changes to the detector's scintillator cocktail are expected in that timeline. We have shown that the negative impacts expected from the higher internal backgrounds of the Te-loaded phase should have minimal impact on the sensitivity to the oscillation parameters over a livetime of 1 year. The sensitivity obtained in this scenario is expected to be somewhat conservative, as the scintillation emission time profile is expected to become substantially shorter~\cite{autyMethodLoadTellurium2023}, % cite something relevant
leading to substantial improvements in the position resolution of the detector as well as the discrimination power of various time-based classifiers.

If the external water backgrounds are able to return to the levels observed during the water phase, and the event selection of internal \ce{^{208}Tl} events improves substantially, there is some scope for improvement to the measurement of \tonetwo{} when considering 1 year of livetime. There are three main possibilities for removal of internal \ce{^{208}Tl} events. Firstly, these $\beta$-decays come as the delayed partner to the $\alpha$-decay branch of \ce{^{214}Bi} nuclei. Therefore, a coincidence tagging approach to remove these events could be possible. Furthermore, alongside the $\beta$-decay of \ce{^{208}Tl} are typically $\gamma$s, which should modify the observed time residual spectrum these events compared to a single-site event like the signal process. As a result, creating a custom multi-site classifier to exclude internal \ce{^{208}Tl} events from single-site events could help further. Finally, solar neutrino and \ce{^{208}Tl} events can in theory be distinguished by their direction. Via a method such as the one developed in~\cite{allegaEventbyEventDirectionReconstruction2023,patonDirectionalReconstructionLiquid2023}, % cite Josie
it might be possible to gain some discrimination power of the solar signal over this background.

On the subject of classifiers, the choice of cuts used for the externals classifiers were chosen to be deliberately conservative. By tuning those cuts, it is possible that the sensitivity could be improved through the increased rejection of external events. An even more sophisticated approach would be to include these classifiers as dimensions of the PDFs. This method yielded substantial improvements in the \onbb{} study performed in~\cite{kroupovaImprovingSensitivityNeutrinoless2020}.

Of course, what has been seen in this analysis is that the greatest barrier to greater precision is simply the signal statistics. This is a function of exposure, not just livetime. Therefore, substantial improvements are likely to be made by increasing the FV used for this analysis. For example, if the maximum radius used in this analysis was moved from \SI{5.0}{\metre} out to \SI{5.7}{\metre}, then the increased volume leads to an increased rate of signal events of 48\%. Admittedly, for energies below $\sim\SI{3.0}{\MeV}$ at larger radii we expect external backgrounds to completely dominate over the signal, so the benefits in the signal statistics will mostly be seen above \SI{5}{\MeV}.

Because the time of day impacts the extent to which solar neutrinos will be travelling through the Earth, there is expected to be some additional power in considering the difference between events observed during the day versus the night. This approach was used to boost the expected sensitivity for the solar oscillation analysis to be used on the JUNO experiment, for example~\cite{abuslemeFeasibilityPhysicsPotential2020,zhaoModelIndependentApproach2022}. % cite JUNO b8 osc measurement paper(s)
Also considered in that sensitivity study were additional interaction modes of solar neutrinos with a liquid scintillator, such as the CC interaction of $\nu_{e}$ on \ce{^{13}C} within the detector. These modes could provide further sensitivity.

Finally, analysis of neutrino oscillations from reactor anti-neutrinos in SNO+ is expected to lead to a world-leading limit of \dmsq{} in under 4 years of livetime~\cite{morton-blakeFirstMeasurementReactor2021}. Although both analysis approaches have sensitivity to \dmsq{} and \tonetwo{}, the reactor anti-neutrino method is more sensitive to \dmsq{} whilst the solar analysis shown above is more sensitive to \tonetwo{}. Because of this complementarity, it is possible that a combined analysis using both types of oscillating neutrino signal incident on SNO+ will lead to even better measurements of both oscillation parameters.
