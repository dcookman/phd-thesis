Measuring the ``solar'' neutrino oscillation parameters \dmsq{} and \tonetwo{} is one of the principal aims of the SNO+ detector during the scintillator-phase. There are, in fact, two complementary methods of measuring these parameters: the oscillations of anti-neutrinos from terrestrial nuclear reactors, and the oscillations of neutrinos from the Sun.

This chapter focuses on the latter approach, using \beight{} neutrinos coming from the Sun to measure the solar oscillation parameters. An initial background-free study was performed by Javi Caravaca~\cite{}, % TODO: Javi's tech note
which demonstrated that it was indeed possible to make such a measurement in the detector. The work in this chapter builds on substantially from that analysis. This chapter also draws on the associated reactor anti-neutrino analysis built by Iwan Morton-Blake~\cite{}, %TODO: Iwan's thesis
and more broadly from the general techniques used in the \onbb{} analysis of Tereza Kroupova~\cite{} and Jack Dunger~\cite{}.% TODO: Tereza & Jack's thesis

This chapter begins by explaining how it is possible to measure the solar oscillation parameters via \beight{} events. Then, the framework used to perform the analysis is then explained: that of a \textit{Bayesian Analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques}. After the method has been described, the dataset upon which the analysis is performed is then introduced. The results and associated validation are then given. Given these results, a projection is then made for the expected sensitivity to \tonetwo{} as a function of livetime.


\section{Analysis Methodology}\label{sec:analysis_method}
\subsection{Observational Principle}
How can we measure neutrino oscillation parameters via solar neutrinos in the SNO+ detector? As discussed in~\label{}, % link to theory section on solar oscillations
it is possible to detect all flavours of neutrino through elastic scattering with electrons in the detector. If this interaction was purely neutral-current, then there would be no way of telling the flavour-state of an interacting neutrino. However, electron neutrinos are able to interact through an additional charged-current mode. This modifies the cross-section for electron neutrinos, and means that as the survival probability for electron neutrinos generated from the Sun, $P_{ee}$, is modified, the interaction probability of neutrinos with the detector will also.

Of course, we do not directly measure neutrino energies in the detector --- only the associated scattered electron. If there were no correlation between the observed electron energy and its associated neutrino, then the only effect of neutrino oscillations would be to change the overall observed rate of events due to this process. There would be no change in the shape of the event's energy spectrum, even though neutrino oscillations are a function of neutrino energy. Fortunately, there is some dependence of the neutrino's energy on that of the scattered electron. This dependence can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:nu_elec_energy_dependence} for \beight{} electron neutrinos interacting in SNO+. % Expected analytical dependence?
As can be seen, the dependence is weak, and comes mostly from basic energy conservation: If one observes a \SI{10}{\MeV} electron event in the detector, it can't reasonably have come from a \SI{5}{\MeV} neutrino.

\begin{figure}

    % \includegraphics[]{}
    \caption[]{}
    \label{fig:nu_elec_energy_dependence2}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:nu_elec_energy_dependence2} we can see the impact each physical process has on the energy spectrum that we eventually observe. We start with a broad energy distribution of \beight{} electron neutrinos generated in the Sun. These neutrinos then oscillate their flavour state as they propagate to the detector, in an energy-dependent manner. When a (tiny) fraction of these neutrinos interact with the electrons in our detector, there is both an energy- and flavour-dependence on the cross-section. The scattered electrons gain a kinetic energy with some mild dependence on the inciting neutrino's energy, which is then measured by the detector to within some energy resolution.

Let us now consider the dependence of $P_{ee}$ on the individual neutrino oscillation parameters. Recall from Eq.~\ref{} %
that, after considering matter-induced oscillations due to neutrinos passing through the Sun and possibly the Earth, $P_{ee} = P_{ee}\left(\tan2\theta^{M}_{12}, \sin\theta^{M}_{13}, \Delta m^{2}_{21,M}\right) = P_{ee}\left(\theta_{12}, \theta_{13}, \Delta m^{2}_{12}, \Delta m^{2}_{13}\right)$. Fig.~\ref{fig:pee_osc_param_dependence} shows the dependence of each of these four oscillation parameters on $P_{ee}(E)$. We can see that in reality only the two parameters \dmsq{} and \tonetwo{} have a substantial impact on $P_{ee}(E)$ and hence the observed electron energy spectrum. Because of this, for this analysis we will only ever vary these two oscillation parameters, and keep $\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{13}$ at their current global fit values\footnote{We use the global fit results excluding Super-Kamiokande's atmospheric data, and assuming normal ordering of the neutrino mass hierarchy. This choice has a tiny impact on the magnitudes of these two fixed parameters, the main impact being the sign of $\Delta m^{2}_{13}$.} % Confirm that mass hierarchy has no impact on Pee.
of $\sin^{2}\theta_{13} = 0.0222$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{13} = +\SI{2.515e-3}{\eV\squared}$~\cite{}.% nufit citation

\subsection{Background Processes}\label{sec:background_processes}
Sadly, elastically-scattered electrons from \beight{} neutrinos are not the only events we see in the SNO+ detector during the scintillator phase. There are a number of background processes that our signal must compete against. Below a reconstructed energy of $\sim\SI{2}{\MeV}$, it is known that various backgrounds completely swamp any possible \beight{} signal, and so for this analysis we only consider processes that can generate reconstructed energies of at least $E_{\textrm{min}} = \SI{2}{\MeV}$. The following subsections explain each of these backgrounds, as well as methods that have been used to mitigate them as much as possible.

\subsubsection{Internal Uranium- and Thorium-Chain Backgrounds}\label{sec:u_th_internals}
Although every effort has been made to make the scintillator cocktail that fills SNO+ to be as radio-pure as possible, there inevitably remain trace amounts of the radioactive isotopes that derive from the decay chains of the \ce{^{238}U} and \ce{^{232}Th} isotopes. Fig.~\ref{fig:u_th_decay_chains} shows these two decay chains. Fortunately, only a fraction of the radioactive isotopes in these chains actually are capable of generating events in the detector with energies above $E_{\textrm{min}}$: these have been highlighted in Fig.~\ref{fig:u_th_decay_chains} in gold.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[]{}
    \caption[]{}
    \label{fig:u_th_decay_chains}
\end{figure}

Of particular note are the decays of \ce{^{212}Bi} and \ce{^{214}Bi}. Both are capable of either $\alpha\textrm{-}$ or $\beta\textrm{-decays}$ to \ce{Tl} or \ce{Po} isotopes, respectively. For the former, it is the subsequent $\beta$-decay of the \ce{Tl} that can have a reconstructed energy above $E_{\textrm{min}}$. For the latter, the \ce{Bi} decay is the part of the pair of decays that can lie above $E_{\textrm{min}}$. Although the $\alpha$-decays here certainly have Q-values well above \SI{2}{\MeV}, the liquid scintillator quenches the observed energy well below $E_{\mathrm{min}}$. The so-called ``\ce{Bi-Po}'' decays are particularly special because the lifetimes of \ce{^{212}Po} and \ce{^{214}Po} are \SI{300}{\nano\second} and \SI{164}{\micro\second}, respectively, which are short enough to allow for highly-effective coincidence tagging.

There are two classes of \ce{Bi-Po} event in the detector: ``out-of-window'' events for which the \ce{Bi} and \ce{Po} occur in separate event windows, and ``in-window'' events whereby the \ce{Bi} and \ce{Po} occur within the same event window. These lead to two distinct strategies for tagging these kinds of events. For out-of-window \ce{Bi-Po}s, we look for a delayed coincidence of two events. Using the tagging algorithm suggested in~\cite{} % Jeanne's BiPo tagging DocDB
as a starting point, the chosen procedure was as follows. There must be two events that trigger the detector within \SI{4}{\micro\second} of one another, and both have a valid \texttt{scintFit} position reconstruction within \SI{2}{\metre} of one another. The delayed candidate event must also have at least 100 cleaned PMT hits. %Must ensure cleaned nhits has been explained earlier
This very broad coincidence tagging procedure was designed to ensure that the cut was as \textit{efficient} in tagging (and hence, rejecting) \ce{Bi-Po}s as possible, whilst negligibly impacting the solar signal. This is in contrast to the cuts chosen by Rafael Hunt-Stokes in~\cite{}, % Raf's BiPo tagging tech note on DocDB
which try and obtain a highly \textit{pure} sample of \ce{Bi-Po} tags.

Of course, the above delayed coincidence procedure cannot catch any of the in-window \ce{Bi-Po} events. For these, we use a different approach. Because two decays happened in the same event window, we expect to see two distinct peaks in the event's time residual spectrum. In order to look for this event topology, a likelihood-ratio classifier was run over events, first developed by Eric Marzec~\cite{} % Eric's tech note on DocDB
and re-coordinated for the \SI{2.2}{\gram\per\litre} LABPPO scintillator optics by Ziping Ye~\cite{}. % Ziping's presentation on DocDB
This classifier calculates the likelihood ratio between the null hypothesis of a \onbb{} event (a proxy in this analysis for single-site events such as our \beight{} signal) and the alternative hypothesis of an in-window \ce{Bi-Po} event. The more negative the value of the result, \texttt{alphabeta212}, the greater the evidence there is for rejecting the null hypothesis of a single-site event. Events with $\texttt{alphabeta212} < 0$ % WRITE FINAL CHOICE OF CUT!
were then rejected.

Combining both out-of-window and in-window \ce{Bi-Po} tagging, the impact on \ce{^{212}Bi-Po}, \ce{^{214}Bi-Po}, and \beight{} $\nu_e$ events can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:bipo_tagging_efficiency}. We consider here only events that pass all other cuts used in this analysis: see section~\ref{} % link to cuts subsection
for the specifics of the cuts used. Because of the different lifetimes of the decays, \ce{^{214}Bi-Po} decays predominantly fall out-of-window whilst \ce{^{212}Bi-Po} events are typically in-window. This explains why the out-of-window tagging is substantially better at cutting \ce{^{214}Bi-Po} decays, whereas the in-window tagging far better tags \ce{^{212}Bi-Po} decays. Overall, within the analysis region of interest (ROI), the two combined cuts are able to tag TODO\% % CALCULATE
of \ce{^{214}Bi-Po} triggered events, TODO\% % CALCULATE
of \ce{^{212}Bi-Po} triggered events, whilst retaining TODO\% % CALCULATE
of \beight{} $\nu_e$ signal events.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\alphan{} Reactions}
The impact of \ce{^{238}U}- and\ce{^{232}Th}-chain isotopes does not simply at their direct decays. It is possible for the $\alpha$s generated during these decays to undergo their own interactions with nuclei in the detector. Within the organic scintillator of SNO+, the dominant interaction of this type is when an $\alpha$ collides with a \ce{^{13}C} nucleus, emitting a neutron: \ce{\alpha{} + ^{13}C -> ^{16}O + n}. This is known as an \alphan{} reaction.

The topology of this reaction in the detector is a delayed coincidence, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:alpha_n_drawing}. % Iwan's alpha-n sketch
For the prompt signal, there is the light emitted from the $\alpha$ just before, and the \ce{n} just after the \alphan{}. The neutron then thermalises and gets captured by another nucleus --- usually hydrogen in SNO+ --- which creates an excited state that then eventually decays, creating a \ce{\gamma} that creates the delayed signal in the detector~\cite{}. % cite an explanation of alpha-n reactions

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[]{}
    \caption[]{}
    \label{fig:alpha_n_drawing}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:alpha_n_coincidence_cut_impact}, \alphan{} interactions can lead to events reconstructed at a wide variety of energies, which could be an issue for this analysis. However, because they are delayed coincidence events with a typical decay time of $\sim\SI{100}{\nano\second}$, the aforementioned out-of-window \ce{Bi-Po} tagging algorithm also efficiently tags \alphan{} events. Looking again at Fig.~\ref{fig:alpha_n_coincidence_cut_impact}, simply by using the out-of-window \ce{Bi-Po} tagger without any further modifications TODO\% of events in the ROI are cut.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[]{}
    \caption[]{}
    \label{fig:alpha_n_coincidence_cut_impact}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{External Backgrounds}
All materials within the SNO+ detector are radioactive, not just the liquid scintillator cocktail. This includes the acrylic, ropes, external water, and PMTs. These components have had their radiopurity ``assayed'' (that is, measured) throughout the detector's lifetime, often back to the construction of the original SNO detector itself. The materials other than the liquid scintillator are known to have far higher background levels, especially in the important \ce{^{238}U}- and \ce{^{232}Th}-chain backgrounds~\cite{}. % good ref for this
To distinguish between the inherent backgrounds within the scintillator, and the backgrounds from materials at larger radii, we use the terminology ``internal'' and ``external'', respectively.

Although there are numerous external backgrounds, with a suitably accurate and precise position reconstruction algorithm they can be suitably handled. The simplest approach is with a so-called ``fiducial volume'' (FV) cut: just throw out all events that reconstruct beyond some radius. The only external background events that will reach within the FV are those that have reconstructed very poorly, or have some long-distance radiation that manages to deposit radiation close to the centre of the AV. % FOM cut?
Because $\alpha$ and $\beta$ radiation can only travel short distances through the detector, it is only $\gamma$ % and neutron?
radiation that can realistically travel far enough into the detector to be able to reconstruct anywhere near the centre. Moreover, the intensity of this $\gamma$ radiation attenuates exponentially towards the centre of the detector, meaning only a tiny fraction of the total number of external events reconstruct within a \SI{3.5}{\metre} FV, say. This strong radial-dependence can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:external_radial_dependence}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[]{}
    \caption[]{}
    \label{fig:external_radial_dependence}
\end{figure}

What this figure also demonstrates is that our solar signal has a completely different radial dependence to these backgrounds. As a result, if one considers not just the energy of events but also their reconstructed radius, then it is possible to get an additional handle on the external backgrounds. The FV cut can then be pushed further out to larger radii, allowing one to gain more signal statistics.

Work by Tereza Kroupova~\cite{} % Tereza's thesis & full-scint re-coordination
allows for additional means of distinguishing external backgrounds from the solar signal. The underlying assumption in the reconstruction of SNO+ events is that there was an electron at a single point, which is entirely valid for \beight{} elastic scattering events. However, external backgrounds can fail this assumption in two ways. Firstly, these radioactive decays often generate $\gamma$ radiation in addition to the main $\alpha$/$\beta$ particle, which creates a multi-site event. Because the \texttt{scintFit} position reconstruction algorithm is not prepared for a distribution of energy depositions in the scintillator, the \tres{} distribution will broaden. This allows an event classifier to be built that distinguishes between the \tres{} distributions of single-site events and externals, known as the ``external background timing classifier''. Secondly, because external backgrounds that do reconstruct close to the centre of the detector typically have a $\gamma$ that travelled a long distance towards the centre of the detector, we expect the earliest light that hits the PMTs to arrive most often along the direction of the reconstructed position vector. A distribution of PMT hits for a given event as a function of their angular distribution relative to the direction of position reconstruction can be built, and compared to the expected distributions for single-site and external background events. This is known as the ``external background topological classifier''. Much like the classifier described in Section~\ref{sec:u_th_internals}, the single-site events used for comparison were \onbb{} events, but these have a similar single-site structure to the solar signal of interest in this analysis.

Fig.~\ref{fig:external_classifier_corr} shows the correlation between the two classifier results for both a typical external background, and \beight{} $\nu_{e}$ events. % DESCRIPTION OF PLOT, HOW A CUT COULD WORK!!

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[]{}
    \caption[]{}
    \label{fig:external_classifier_corr}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Cosmogenic Isotopes}
The final source of background events are radioactive isotopes that form via collisions of cosmic rays with atomic nuclei, known as cosmogenic isotopes. Most of these isotopes are short-lived~\cite{}, % cite Borexino/KamLAND(?) paper handling cosmogenics
with lifetimes $\mathcal{O}(\SI{1}{\second})$. Fortunately, the depth of SNO+ means that our rate of cosmic ray muons interacting with the detector is only 3 an hour~\cite{}. % cite Lorna/Katharine; Q: confident only muons? What about other kinds of cosmic rays? Presumably nothing else can penetrate this far with high enough rates
Because the rate is so low relative to other experiments, relatively straightforward approaches to tagging and removing cosmic ray muons and their cosmogenic followers can be utilised without substantial loss of livetime. Events are tagged as a cosmic ray muon if they create a sufficient number of hits in the outward-looking PMTs above background levels, as well as many hits within the detector itself. The details of this tagging for the scintillator-fill were put in place by Lorna Nolan~\cite{}, % Lorna's thesis(?); Katharine's contribution?
modifying the existing algorithms used in the water-phase~\cite{} % Billy's Thesis
and in SNO~\cite{}. % Appropriate SNO citation (old thesis?)
After a tagged cosmic muon event, all events for the next \SI{20}{\second} are then vetoed as a means of rejecting followers. This simple cut is enough to remove the vast majority of expected cosmogenic events in the scintillator-phase. % CITATION?
The expected impact on loss of livetime, and hence quantity of signal events, is 3 lots of \SI{20}{\second} vetoes an hour, that is to say 1/60\textsuperscript{th} of the signal is lost via this cut.

There is one cosmogenic isotope with a long-enough half-life that even the \SI{20}{\second} muon follower veto is not sufficient to remove all events. This is \ce{^{11}C}, which \ce{\beta+}-decays to stable \ce{^{11}B} with a half-life of \SI{20.4}{\minute}. The maximum possible energy deposited in this decay is \SI{1.982}{\MeV}~\cite{}, % CITATION
just below $E_{\textrm{min}}$, so only a small fraction of \ce{^{11}C} events end up in the ROI: the ones with very high energies that get their energy reconstruction falsely-inflated by some amount. As a result, this background is expected to be very much sub-dominant to all other backgrounds in this analysis. Because this background is important to consider for some other analyses, a triple-coincidence tagging algorithm is being built by Katharine Dixon~\cite{}, % Katharine C11 citation
but not used for this analysis currently.% Maybe this changes? will see if constraint needed.

\subsection{The Log-likelihood Test Statistic}
At the highest level, this analysis involves taking the data observed in the scintillator-fill after applying a certain set of cuts, along with simulated PDFs for all processes believed to build up the observed data with those same cuts applied, and then attempting to fit the combined energy and radial distributions of the MC to that of the data. Given a set of PDFs, to try and match the distribution of observables in data we can modify a number of parameters. These consist of the normalisations of each PDF (i.e. the total number of events observed due to that process), and any systematic parameters that could modify the shapes of these distributions. For this analysis, the neutrino oscillation parameters act as \textit{de facto} systematic parameters, as they modify the shape of the \beight{} PDFs. Of course, unlike usual systematics the oscillation parameters are what we are actively trying to measure, instead of being a nuisance.

In order to perform a fit to data in this way, we must first answer a set of questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Which signal and background processes must we consider?\label{q:signal_v_background}
    \item In addition to their normalisations, are there any further parameters necessary to specify the distributions of the PDFs for each of the processes? Systematics and oscillation parameters are good examples.
    \item What is our test statistic?\label{q:test_statistic}
    \item What algorithm do we use to try and find the best-fit result?
    \item How do we measure uncertainties on these best-fit values for each parameter?
\end{enumerate}
In section~\ref{sec:background_processes}, question~\ref{q:signal_v_background} was answered for this analysis. We now give the answer to question~\ref{q:test_statistic}; all other questions on this list will be answered shortly.

The test statistic used for this analysis is the \textit{binned extended log-likelihood.} Once the data and MC PDFs have been binned in both the observables of interest, it is assumed that the expected number of events in a given bin $j$ is governed by a Poisson distribution:

\begin{equation}
    P_{j}\left(n_{j} | \lambda_{j}\right) = \frac{\lambda_{j}^{n_{j}}e^{-\lambda_{j}}}{n_{j}!},
\end{equation}
where $P_{j}\left(n_{j} | \lambda_{j}\right)$ is the probability of observing $n_{j}$ events in bin $j$, given an expectation of $\lambda_{j}$ events in total from signal and background processes in that bin. This $\lambda_{j}$ can be decomposed into each of the expected rates for each process, $i$:

\begin{equation}
    \lambda_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{PDFs}} \mathcal{N}_{i}P_{ij}\left(\bm{\theta}\right),
\end{equation}
where $N_{\textrm{PDF}}$ is the number of PDFs being considered in the analysis, $\mathcal{N}_{i}$ is the normalisation parameter of the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ PDF, and $P_{ij}\left(\bm{\theta}\right)$ is the probability of observing an event of process type $j$ in bin $i$, assuming a set of non-normalisation parameters $\bm{\theta}$. By combining the probabilities of all the bins together, and also adding the possibility of constraining any of the normalisation or systematic parameters $\bm{\mathcal{N}}$ or $\bm{\theta}$, the total probability for a given set of processes assuming these parameters to give rise to the data seen is:

\begin{align}
    P\left(\bm{n} | \bm{\mathcal{N}}, \bm{\theta}\right) = 
    L\left(\bm{\mathcal{N}}, \bm{\theta} | \bm{n}\right) &= 
    \prod_{j=1}^{N_{\textrm{bins}}} \frac{\left[\sum_{i=1}^{N_{PDFs}} \mathcal{N}_{i}P_{ij}\left(\bm{\theta}\right)\right]^{n_{j}}e^{-\sum_{i=1}^{N_{PDFs}} \mathcal{N}_{i}P_{ij}\left(\bm{\theta}\right)}}{n_{j}!}\nonumber\\
    &\cdot\prod_{k=1}^{N_{\mathcal{N}'}}\frac{e^{-\frac{\left(\mathcal{N}_{k}' - \mathcal{N}_{k}^{\mathrm{nom}}\right)^2}{2(\sigma_{k}^{\mathcal{N}})^{2}}}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_{k}^{\mathcal{N}}}}
    \cdot\prod_{\ell=1}^{N_{\theta'}}\frac{e^{-\frac{\left(\theta_{\ell}' - \theta_{\ell}^{\mathrm{nom}}\right)^2}{2(\sigma_{\ell}^{\theta})^{2}}}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_{\ell}^{\theta}}}.
\end{align}
Here, $N_{\mathrm{bins}}$ is the total number of bins being considered in the analysis. Gaussian constraints\footnote{} %
on a subset of the normalisations have been included, $\left\{\mathcal{N}'\right\}$, of which there are $N_{\mathcal{N}'}$ in total. For each of these normalisations, indexed by $k$, there is an associated nominal value $\mathcal{N}_{k}^{\mathrm{nom}}$ and width $\sigma_{k}^{\mathcal{N}}$. There are similar constraints on a subset of the systematic parameters, with similarly-named variables.




     \begin{itemize}
        % \item Start with observational principle: changes in oscillation parameters lead to change in the energy spectrum of neutrinos elastically-scattering in the detector, and hence a change in the observed energy spectra of elastically-scattered electrons within the detector. Demonstrate basic impact on modifying $\Delta m^{2}_{21}$ and $\theta_{12}$.
        \item Want to maximise the sensitivity to measuring these two parameters. Energy spectrum of signal is background-free above $\sim\SI{5}{\MeV}$, but rate is substantially larger at lower energies. If one can minimise backgrounds at the lower energies, then there should be hopes of obtaining a measurement with greater precision!
        \item Set up analysis approach: a Bayesian analysis using MCMC. Explain why this was chosen at a high level first: allows for us to perform a relatively complex analysis with multidimensional PDFs, numerous backgrounds, systematics, constraints on parameters, all whilst allowing us to obtain well-defined measures of uncertainty on our final results.
        \item Test statistic: binned extended log-likelihood. Explain why this is fundamentally the ``right''  test statistic to use. Allows for handling of constraints and systematics.
        \item Give an overview of how an MCMC works. Key idea: exploring parameter space in such a way as to reproduce posterior density distribution. Clever! Helps to avoid ``curse of dimensionality'' that often arises in fits with numerous parameters. Must also explain how we work in a fundamentally Bayesian, not frequentist, statistical approach.
        % \item Explain background processes we'll be dealing with: can be distinguished by event topology, energy spectrum, and position distribution.
        \item Explain cuts that I am using for the analysis. Demonstrate how these attempt to maximise our signal sensitivity. Leads nicely into choice of 2D fit in both energy and radius (cubed).
        \item Describe implementation of neutrino oscillations within the fitting procedure: flat priors on the oscillation parameters, but a strong constraint from the solar flux. Explain choices of constraint that are possible. MCMC varies oscillation parameters and flux scaling factor, which then modifies the solar signal PDFs through a de-facto systematic that is a function of true neutrino energy, a 3\textsuperscript{rd} ``bookkeeping'' dimension in the signal's PDFs only. Neutrino oscillations simulated via PSelmaa, which accounts for MSW effect in both the Sun and the Earth. For computational speed, at run-time we actually use a lookup table with linear interpolation for the survival probability as a function of parameters.
        \item Implementation of systematics: we handle them generally as linear transformations acting on the vector of bin data. Clever! Which systematics do we expect to be particularly important for this analysis? Well, mismodelling in detector optics etc. can lead to changes in the measured energy spectrum of processes, which can be decomposed into an energy scale term and an energy smearing term to first order. Systematics also possible in the radial dimension (expected to be less important?)

\begin{itemize}
    \item Description of dataset chosen for analysis: full-scint data that satisfies the ``gold'' list of run selection requirements, between 1\textsuperscript{st} June 2022 and March 2023. Starting date chosen to ensure radon levels have stabilised within the centre of the detector.
    \item Impact of cuts on data and MC. Show tables (the full details maybe in an appendix) indicating this.
    \item Describe the constraints chosen to apply to the fit, and why they can be justified.
    \item Running \& validation of MCMC fitting. Show plots of parameter values versus step, to demonstrate that the step sizes have been tuned sufficiently. Show auto-correlation plots, to motivate a sensible ``burn-in'' size. Show posterior density plots for each nuisance parameter, to check that they all look sensible and have sufficient statistics. Show plot of correlation coefficients between parameters, and look at any correlations that are particularly interesting.
    \item Look at the data versus MC plot in energy, radius, and both. Is there a good fit to data? Any clear disagreements?
    \item Show 2D contour plot for oscillation parameter posterior density. Note salient features. Show 1D posterior densities for each oscillation parameter. Derive measurement result for $\theta_{12}$.
