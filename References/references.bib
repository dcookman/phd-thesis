  abstract = {The SNO+ experiment is located 2 km underground at SNOLAB in Sudbury, Canada. A low background search for neutrinoless double beta (0{$\nu\beta\beta$}) decay will be conducted using 780 tonnes of liquid scintillator loaded with 3.9 tonnes of natural tellurium, corresponding to 1.3 tonnes of 130Te. This paper provides a general overview of the SNO+ experiment, including detector design, construction of process plants, commissioning efforts, electronics upgrades, data acquisition systems, and calibration techniques. The SNO+ collaboration is reusing the acrylic vessel, PMT array, and electronics of the SNO detector, having made a number of experimental upgrades and essential adaptations for use with the liquid scintillator. With low backgrounds and a low energy threshold, the SNO+ collaboration will also pursue a rich physics program beyond the search for 0{$\nu\beta\beta$} decay, including studies of geo- and reactor antineutrinos, supernova and solar neutrinos, and exotic physics such as the search for invisible nucleon decay. The SNO+ approach to the search for 0{$\nu\beta\beta$} decay is scalable: a future phase with high 130Te-loading is envisioned to probe an effective Majorana mass in the inverted mass ordering region.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A liquid scintillator consisting of linear alkylbenzene as the solvent and 2,5-diphenyloxazole as the fluor was developed for the SNO+ experiment. This mixture was chosen as it is compatible with acrylic and has a competitive light yield to pre-existing liquid scintillators while conferring other advantages including longer attenuation lengths, superior safety characteristics, chemical simplicity, ease of handling, and logistical availability. Its properties have been extensively characterized and are presented here. This liquid scintillator is now used in several neutrino physics experiments in addition to SNO+.},

It reuses the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory detector, consisting of a 12\,m diameter acrylic vessel which will be filled with about 780 tonnes of ultra-pure liquid scintillator. Designed as a multipurpose neutrino experiment, the primary goal of SNO+ is a search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay (0                                {$\nu$}                 {$\beta$}                 {$\beta$}                              ) of               130               Te. In Phase I, the detector will be loaded with 0.3\% natural tellurium, corresponding to nearly 800\,kg of               130               Te, with an expected effective Majorana neutrino mass sensitivity in the region of 55\textendash 133\,meV, just above the inverted mass hierarchy. Recently, the possibility of deploying up to ten times more natural tellurium has been investigated, which would enable SNO+ to achieve sensitivity deep into the parameter space for the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy in the future. Additionally, SNO+ aims to measure reactor antineutrino oscillations, low energy solar neutrinos, and geoneutrinos, to be sensitive to supernova neutrinos, and to search for exotic physics. A first phase with the detector filled with water will begin soon, with the scintillator phase expected to start after a few months of water data taking. The                                0                 {$\nu$}                 {$\beta$}                 {$\beta$}                              Phase I is foreseen for 2017.},

  abstract = {The behaviors of various confidence/credible interval constructions are explored, particularly in the region of low event numbers where methods diverge most. We highlight a number of challenges, such as the treatment of nuisance parameters, and common misconceptions associated with such constructions. An informal survey of the literature suggests that confidence intervals are not always defined in relevant ways and are too often misinterpreted and/or misapplied. This can lead to seemingly paradoxical behaviors and flawed comparisons regarding the relevance of experimental results. We therefore conclude that there is a need for a more pragmatic strategy which recognizes that, while it is critical to objectively convey the information content of the data, there is also a strong desire to derive bounds on model parameter values and a natural instinct to interpret things this way. Accordingly, we attempt to put aside philosophical biases in favor of a practical view to propose a more transparent and self-consistent approach that better addresses these issues.},

The 16N is produced via the (n,p) reaction on 16O in the form of CO2 gas using 14-MeV neutrons from a commercially available Deuterium-Tritium (DT) generator. The 16N is produced in a shielding pit in a utility room near the SNO cavity and transferred to the water volumes (D2O or H2O) in a CO2 gas stream via small diameter capillary tubing. The bulk of the activity decays in a decay/trigger chamber designed to block the energetic b-particles yet permit the primary branch 6.13 MeV g-rays to exit. Detection of the coincident b-particles with plastic scintillator lining the walls of the decay chamber volume provides a tag for the SNO electronics. This paper gives details of the production, transfer, and triggering systems for this source along with a discussion of the source g-ray output and performance. r 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The CP conserving value {$\delta$}CP = 180\textdegree{} is within 0.6{$\sigma$} of the global best fit point.

The previous 2.2{$\sigma$} tension in {$\increment$}m221 preferred by KamLAND and solar experiments is also reduced to the 1.1{$\sigma$} level after the inclusion of the latest Super-Kamiokande solar neutrino results.

  abstract = {In 1934 P. A. \v{C}erenkov has discovered a peculiar phenomenon, whicd he has since investigated in detail (1). All liquids and solids if bombarded by fast electrons, such as {$\beta$}-electrons or Compton electrons produced by {$\gamma$}-rays, do emit a peculiar visible radiation, quite different from the eventual ordinary flourescence. This radiation is partially polarized, the electric oscillation vector being parallel to the electron beam, and its intensity can be reduced neither by temperature nor by addition to the liquid bombarded of quenching substances. The peculiarity of these carac-teristics was scrutinized by Wawilow (2) who suggested that this radiation must be connected with the \guillemotleft Bremsung\guillemotright{} of fast electrons. Since then a new and undoubtedly the most peculiar characteristic of the phenomenon was discovered, namely, its highly pronounced asymmetry, the intensity of light emitted, in the direction of the motion of electrons being many times larger than in the backward direction. It follows that the substance bombarded radiates coherently for the space of at least one wavelength of the visible light.}

Particular emphasis is given to the general purpose nature of ORCA and the manner in which it provides generic object-oriented software modules that can be configured and connected together at run-time to build general-purpose data acquisition applications. ORCA is the main graphical user interface for the NCD experiment and is used for hardware initialization, run control, data readout, and data shipping.},

Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.             The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.             The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.},

The energy spectrum of the electrons, or {$\beta$}-rays, is continuous: if energy is conserved, another, variable, amount of energy must somehow leave the system. In 1927, Ellis and Wooster [Nature 119, 563\textendash 564 (1927)] tried \textemdash{} and failed \textemdash{} to capture and measure that missing energy. By 1933, Pauli had devised an explanation in terms of another, undetected, particle being emitted by the nucleus; Fermi called it 'the neutrino'. Only in 1956 was the existence of the neutrino proved: Reines and Cowan [Nature 178, 446\textendash 449 (1956)] sent Pauli a telegram to inform him of their discovery.},

  abstract = {Theoretical predictions for elastic neutrino-electron scattering have no hadronic or nuclear uncertainties at leading order making this process an important tool for normalizing neutrino flux. However, the process is subject to large radiative corrections that differ according to experimental conditions. In this paper, we collect new and existing results for total and differential cross sections accompanied by radiation of one photon, \$\textbackslash nu e \textbackslash to \textbackslash nu e (\textbackslash gamma)\$. We perform calculations within the Fermi effective theory and provide analytic expressions for the electron energy spectrum and for the total electromagnetic energy spectrum as well as for double- and triple-differential cross sections with respect to electron energy, electron angle, photon energy, and photon angle. We discuss illustrative applications to accelerator-based neutrino experiments and provide the most precise up-to-date values of neutrino-electron scattering cross sections. We present an analysis of theoretical error, which is dominated by the \$\textbackslash sim 0.2 - 0.4\textbackslash\%\$ uncertainty of the hadronic correction. We also discuss how searches for new physics can be affected by radiative corrections.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the energy spectrum of \$\^8\$B neutrinos is an important ingredient for interpreting experiments that detect energetic neutrinos from the Sun. The neutrino spectrum deviates from the allowed approximation because of the broad alpha-unstable \$\^8\$Be final state and recoil order corrections to the beta decay. We have measured the total energy of the alpha particles emitted following the beta decay of \$\^8\$B. The measured spectrum is inconsistent with some previous measurements, in particular with a recent experiment of comparable precision. The beta decay strength function for the transition from \$\^8\$B to the accessible excitation energies in \$\^8\$Be is fit to the alpha energy spectrum using the R-matrix approach. Both the positron and neutrino energy spectra, corrected for recoil order effects, are constructed from the strength function. The positron spectrum is in good agreement with a previous direct measurement. The neutrino spectrum disagrees with previous experiments, particularly for neutrino energies above 12 MeV.},

We investigate the anisotropy of the Rayleigh scattering in LAB, showing that the resulting Rayleigh scattering length will be significantly shorter than reported before. Given the same overall light attenuation, this will result in a more efficient transmission of photons through the scintillator, increasing the amount of light collected by the photosensors and thereby the energy resolution of the detector.},
